# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is for acknowledging all of the people who helped out -->

I realize that I owe where I am today to a lot of hard work by people who came before me. They established both the scientific ideas and the institutions that provided the fertile ground for my little research project to grow. It's a modest contribution that I've made, but I hope that I've at least managed to push the cart a little further down the road, ready for the next person to take it on. Specifically, I'd like to thank Dr. Sheena Josselyn for taking a chance with me and inducting me into the ranks of professional scientists with her savvy and wise advice. I also thank Dr. David Ehrlich for taking me under his wing at the start and respecting my neophytic scientific ideas, Dr. Valentina Mercaldo for her strict and vaguely maternal mentorship throughout this project, Dr. Adelaide Yiu for being a noteworthy predecessor and an exemplar of organization, discipline, and dedication, Dr. Sung Mo Park for helping me get riled up by the excitement of scientific investigation, Dr. Sherwin Nicholson for making this entire investigation possible with his masterful surgical technique, Dr. Adam Santoro for turning me on to sparse coding over hefeweizen, my Master's student cohort, Lina Tran, Colleen Gillon, Patrick Steadman, Bonny Hou, and Lyn Ann for proviiding cameraderie and fellow feeling, and my committee members Dr. Lu Yang Wang and Dr. Mei Zhen for guiding me through the demonstrably difficult process of obtaining a Master's degree.
