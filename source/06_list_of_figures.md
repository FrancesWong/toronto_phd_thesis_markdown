# List of figures {.unnumbered}

<!-- 
This is one of the biggest drawbacks to writing in Markdown: it is not possible to add a short caption to figures and tables. This means that the \listoftables and \listoffigures commands will generate lists using the full titles, which is probably isn't what you want. For now, the solution is to create the lists manually, when everything else is finished. I found that LaTeX was indenting the list items (due to the indentation settings that are declared in the style file), so I simply added a \noindent tag before every line to prevent that. There is undoubtedly a better solution out there.
