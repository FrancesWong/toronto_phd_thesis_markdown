Memories are stored in the brain by discrete physiological changes, collectively referred to as an engram, that allow patterns of activity present during learning to be retrieved in the future. The work in this thesis tests the prediction from computational studies and experimental data that, within a given brain region such as the lateral amygdala, only a small proportion of neurons encodes any one memory and that this proportion remains relatively stable across different memories. First, it demonstrates that the size of the LA component of an engram remains constant between memories of different strengths. Then, it implicates parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the mechanisms that constraing the engram to a sparse proportion of neurons. Together, these results thesis provide additional support for the notion that the LA employs a sparse distributed coding scheme to store memories.
