  abstract = {In the mammalian nervous system, neuronal activity regulates the strength and number of synapses formed. The genetic program that coordinates this process is poorly understood. We show that myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors suppressed excitatory synapse number in a neuronal activity- and calcineurin-dependent manner as hippocampal neurons formed synapses. In response to increased neuronal activity, calcium influx into neurons induced the activation of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylated and activated MEF2. When activated, MEF2 promoted the transcription of a set of genes, including arc and synGAP, that restrict synapse number. These findings define an activity-dependent transcriptional program that may control synapse number during development.},

  doi = {10.1101/lm.039222.115},
  abstract = {Norepinephrine (NE) is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain structure crucially involved in memory formation. NE boosts synaptic plasticity mostly through initiation of signaling cascades downstream from beta (\ensuremath{\beta})-adrenergic receptors (\ensuremath{\beta}-ARs). Previous studies demonstrated that a \ensuremath{\beta}-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, can modify the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative cellular mechanism for learning and memory, in a process known as "metaplasticity." Metaplasticity is the ability of synaptic plasticity to be modified by prior experience. We asked whether NE itself could engage metaplastic mechanisms in area CA1 of mouse hippocampal slices. Using extracellular field potential recording and stimulation, we show that application of NE (10 \ensuremath{\mathrm{\mu}}M), which did not alter basal synaptic strength, enhances the future maintenance of LTP elicited by subthreshold, high-frequency stimulation (HFS: 1 \texttimes{} 100 Hz, 1 sec). HFS applied 30 min after NE washout induced long-lasting (\ensuremath{>}4 h) LTP, which was significantly extended in duration relative to HFS alone. This NE-induced metaplasticity required \ensuremath{\beta}1-AR activation, as coapplication of the \ensuremath{\beta}1-receptor antagonist CGP-20712A (1 \ensuremath{\mathrm{\mu}}M) attenuated maintenance of LTP. We also found that NE-mediated metaplasticity was translation- and transcription-dependent. Polysomal profiles of CA1 revealed increased translation rates for specific mRNAs during NE-induced metaplasticity. Thus, activation of \ensuremath{\beta}-ARs by NE primes synapses for future long-lasting plasticity on time scales extending beyond fast synaptic transmission; this may facilitate neural information processing and the subsequent formation of lasting memories.},

  abstract = {Many philosophical and contemplative traditions teach that ``living in the moment'' increases happiness. However, the default mode of humans appears to be that of mind-wandering, which correlates with unhappiness, and with activation in a network of brain areas associated with self-referential processing. We investigated brain activity in experienced meditators and matched meditation-naive controls as they performed several different meditations (Concentration, Loving-Kindness, Choiceless Awareness). We found that the main nodes of the default-mode network (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) were relatively deactivated in experienced meditators across all meditation types. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger coupling in experienced meditators between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (regions previously implicated in self-monitoring and cognitive control), both at baseline and during meditation. Our findings demonstrate differences in the default-mode network that are consistent with decreased mind-wandering. As such, these provide a unique understanding of possible neural mechanisms of meditation.},

Neuroscientists have long appreciated that the amygdala mediates spatially nonspecific emotional responses, but it remains unclear whether the amygdala links motivational and spatial representations. To test whether amygdala neurons encode spatial and motivational information, we presented reward-predictive cues in different spatial configurations to monkeys and assessed how these cues influenced spatial attention. Cue configuration and predicted reward magnitude modulated amygdala neural activity in a coordinated fashion. Moreover, fluctuations in activity were correlated with trial-to-trial variability in spatial attention. Thus, the amygdala integrates spatial and motivational information, which may influence the spatial allocation of cognitive resources. These results suggest that amygdala dysfunction may contribute to deficits in cognitive processes normally coordinated with emotional responses, such as the directing of attention toward the location of emotionally relevant stimuli.},

  abstract = {During auditory fear conditioning, it is well established that lateral amygdala (LA) neurons potentiate their response to the tone conditioned stimulus, and that this potentiation is required for conditioned fear behavior. Conditioned tone responses in LA, however, last only a few hundred milliseconds and cannot be responsible for sustained fear responses to a tone lasting tens of seconds. Recent evidence from inactivation and stimulation studies suggests that the prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex is necessary for expression of learned fears, but the timing of PL tone responses and correlations with fear behavior have not been studied. Using multichannel unit recording techniques in behaving rats, we observed sustained conditioned tone responses in PL that were correlated with freezing behavior on a second-to-second basis during the presentation of a 30 s tone. PL tone responses were also correlated with conditioned freezing across different experimental phases (habituation, conditioning, extinction). Moreover, the persistence of PL responses after extinction training was associated with failure to express extinction memory. Together with previous inactivation findings, the present results suggest that PL transforms transient amygdala inputs to a sustained output that drives conditioned fear responses and gates the expression of extinction. Given the relatively long latency of conditioned responses we observed in PL (approximately 100 ms after tone onset), we propose that PL integrates inputs from the amygdala, hippocampus, and other cortical sources to regulate the expression of fear memories.},

  title = {Structural {{Plasticity Can Produce Metaplasticity}}},
  volume = {4},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0008062},
  abstract = {Background
Synaptic plasticity underlies many aspect of learning memory and development. The properties of synaptic plasticity can change as a function of previous plasticity and previous activation of synapses, a phenomenon called metaplasticity. Synaptic plasticity not only changes the functional connectivity between neurons but in some cases produces a structural change in synaptic spines; a change thought to form a basis for this observed plasticity. Here we examine to what extent structural plasticity of spines can be a cause for metaplasticity. This study is motivated by the observation that structural changes in spines are likely to affect the calcium dynamics in spines. Since calcium dynamics determine the sign and magnitude of synaptic plasticity, it is likely that structural plasticity will alter the properties of synaptic plasticity.

Methodology/Principal Findings
In this study we address the question how spine geometry and alterations of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors conductance may affect plasticity. Based on a simplified model of the spine in combination with a calcium-dependent plasticity rule, we demonstrated that after the induction phase of plasticity a shift of the long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD) threshold takes place. This induces a refractory period for further LTP induction and promotes depotentiation as observed experimentally. That resembles the BCM metaplasticity rule but specific for the individual synapse. In the second phase, alteration of the NMDA response may bring the synapse to a state such that further synaptic weight alterations are feasible. We show that if the enhancement of the NMDA response is proportional to the area of the post synaptic density (PSD) the plasticity curves most likely return to the initial state.

Conclusions/Significance
Using simulations of calcium dynamics in synaptic spines, coupled with a biophysically motivated calcium-dependent plasticity rule, we find under what conditions structural plasticity can form the basis of synapse specific metaplasticity.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness meditation practices (MMPs) are a subgroup of meditation practices which are receiving growing attention. The present paper reviews current evidence about the effects of MMPs on objective measures of cognitive functions. Five databases were searched. Twenty three studies providing measures of attention, memory, executive functions and further miscellaneous measures of cognition were included. Fifteen were controlled or randomized controlled studies and 8 were case-control studies. Overall, reviewed studies suggested that early phases of mindfulness training, which are more concerned with the development of focused attention, could be associated with significant improvements in selective and executive attention whereas the following phases, which are characterized by an open monitoring of internal and external stimuli, could be mainly associated with improved unfocused sustained attention abilities. Additionally, MMPs could enhance working memory capacity and some executive functions. However, many of the included studies show methodological limitations and negative results have been reported as well, plausibly reflecting differences in study design, study duration and patients' populations. Accordingly, even though findings here reviewed provided preliminary evidence suggesting that MMPs could enhance cognitive functions, available evidence should be considered with caution and further high quality studies investigating more standardized mindfulness meditation programs are needed.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Many people meditate to reduce psychological stress and stress-related health problems. To counsel people appropriately, clinicians need to know what the evidence says about the health benefits of meditation.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of meditation programs in improving stress-related outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress/distress, positive mood, mental health-related quality of life, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, pain, and weight) in diverse adult clinical populations.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: We identified randomized clinical trials with active controls for placebo effects through November 2012 from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, PsycArticles, Scopus, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library, and hand searches. Two independent reviewers screened citations and extracted data. We graded the strength of evidence using 4 domains (risk of bias, precision, directness, and consistency) and determined the magnitude and direction of effect by calculating the relative difference between groups in change from baseline. When possible, we conducted meta-analyses using standardized mean differences to obtain aggregate estimates of effect size with 95\% confidence intervals.
FINDINGS: After reviewing 18 753 citations, we included 47 trials with 3515 participants. Mindfulness meditation programs had moderate evidence of improved anxiety (effect size, 0.38 [95\% CI, 0.12-0.64] at 8 weeks and 0.22 [0.02-0.43] at 3-6 months), depression (0.30 [0.00-0.59] at 8 weeks and 0.23 [0.05-0.42] at 3-6 months), and pain (0.33 [0.03- 0.62]) and low evidence of improved stress/distress and mental health-related quality of life. We found low evidence of no effect or insufficient evidence of any effect of meditation programs on positive mood, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, and weight. We found no evidence that meditation programs were better than any active treatment (ie, drugs, exercise, and other behavioral therapies).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Clinicians should be aware that meditation programs can result in small to moderate reductions of multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress. Thus, clinicians should be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation program could have in addressing psychological stress. Stronger study designs are needed to determine the effects of meditation programs in improving the positive dimensions of mental health and stress-related behavior.},

  abstract = {The amygdala is a temporal lobe structure that is required for processing emotional information. Polymodal sensory information enters the amygdala at the level of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and undergoes local processing, after which the behavioral and autonomic responses that accompany emotions are initiated. Two main neuron types are present in the BLA, pyramidal-like principal neurons that use glutamate as their transmitter, and local circuit interneurons that use GABA as their transmitter. Although the properties of principal neurons are known in some detail, very little is known about the properties of BLA interneurons or the local circuits in which they are involved. Using mice in which EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) is expressed under the control of the parvalbumin promoter, we characterized the properties of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the BLA. By making recordings from interneuron\textendash{}interneuron and interneuron\textendash{}principal neuron pairs, we analyzed the intrinsic circuitry of the BLA. We show that parvalbumin-positive interneurons can be divided into four subtypes as defined by their firing properties. Interneurons are electrically coupled in subtype-specific networks and exhibit subtype-specific heterogeneities in their synaptic dynamics and patterns of connectivity. We propose that these properties allow networks of parvalbumin-expressing neurons to perform an array of information-processing tasks within the BLA.},

We measured salivary DHEA, DHEAS and cortisol both before each task and at 30 and 60 min. Under working memory load, a higher baseline cortisol/DHEA ratio was related to higher distraction as indexed by an enhanced novelty P3. This suggests that cortisol may lead to increased distraction whereas DHEA may hinder distraction by leading to less processing of the distractor. An increased DHEA production with consecutive cognitive tasks was found and higher DHEA responses attributed to working memory load were related to enhanced working memory processing as indexed by an enhanced visual P300. Overall, the results suggest that in women DHEA may oppose cortisol effects reducing distraction and that a higher DHEA response may enhance working memory at the electrophysiological level.},

  abstract = {A variety of acute brain insults bear the risk of subsequent development of chronic epilepsy. Enhanced understanding of the brain alterations underlying this process may ultimately lead to interventions that prevent, interrupt or reverse epileptogenesis in people at risk. Various interventions have been evaluated in rat models of symptomatic epilepsy, in which epileptogenesis was induced by status epilepticus (SE) or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Paradoxically, recent data indicated that administration of proconvulsant drugs after TBI or SE exerts antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying effects, although epilepsy is often considered to represent a decrease in seizure threshold. Surprisingly, to our knowledge, it is not known whether alterations in seizure threshold occur during the latent period following SE. This prompted us to study seizure threshold during and after the latent period following SE induced by lithium/pilocarpine in rats. Timed intravenous infusion of the GABAA receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) was used for this purpose. The duration of the latent period was determined by continuous video/EEG monitoring. Compared to control seizure threshold determined before SE, threshold significantly decreased two days after SE, but returned to pre-SE control thereafter. Moreover, the duration of PTZ-induced seizures was significantly increased throughout the latent period, which ranged from 6 to 10 days after SE. This increased susceptibility to PTZ likely reflects the complex alterations in GABA-mediated transmission that occur during the latent period following SE. The data will allow developing dosing regimens for evaluation of whether treatment with subconvulsant doses of PTZ during the latent period affects the development of epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Background: The authors sought to examine whether levels of dehydroepiandrosterone are abnormal in depression. Methods: Three groups of subjects aged 20\textendash{}64 were studied: 44 major depressives, 35 subjects with partially or completely remitted depression, matched as far as possible for age and drug treatment, and 41 normal control subjects. Dehydroepiandrosterone and cortisol in saliva were determined from specimens taken at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm on 4 days. Results: The mean age of the three groups did not differ. Dehydroepiandrosterone was lowered at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm compared with control subjects. Values for the remitted group were intermediate. Dehydroepiandrosterone levels at 8:00 am correlated negatively with severity of depression and were not related to drug treatment or smoking, but decreased with age (as expected). Cortisol was elevated in depression in the evening. The molar cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone ratio also differentiated those with depression from the control group. Conclusions: Lowered dehydroepiandrosterone levels are an additional state abnormality in adult depression. Adrenal steroid changes are thus not limited to cortisol. Because dehydroepiandrosterone may antagonize some effects of cortisol and may have mood improving properties, these findings may have significant implications for the pathophysiology of depression.},

  abstract = {Learning-induced modulation of neuronal intrinsic excitability is a metaplasticity mechanism that can impact the acquisition of new memories. Although the amygdala is important for emotional learning and other behaviors, including fear and anxiety, whether learning alters intrinsic excitability within the amygdala has received very little attention. Fear conditioning was combined with intracellular recordings to investigate the effects of learning on the intrinsic excitability of lateral amygdala (LA) neurons. To assess time-dependent changes, brain slices were prepared either immediately or 24-h post-conditioning. Fear conditioning significantly enhanced excitability of LA neurons, as evidenced by both decreased afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and increased neuronal firing. These changes were time-dependent such that reduced AHPs were evident at both time points whereas increased neuronal firing was only observed at the later (24-h) time point. Moreover, these changes occurred within a subset (32\%) of LA neurons. Previous work also demonstrated that learning-related changes in synaptic plasticity are also evident in less than one-third of amygdala neurons, suggesting that the neurons undergoing intrinsic plasticity may be critical for fear memory. These data may be clinically relevant as enhanced LA excitability following fear learning could influence future amygdala-dependent behaviors.},

  abstract = {Memories are encoded within sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles. However, the defining cellular properties of neurons within a memory trace remain incompletely understood. Using a fluorescence-based Arc reporter, we were able to visually identify the distinct subset of lateral amygdala (LA) neurons activated during auditory fear conditioning. We found that Arc-expressing neurons have enhanced intrinsic excitability and are preferentially recruited into newly encoded memory traces. Furthermore, synaptic potentiation of thalamic inputs to the LA during fear conditioning is learning-specific, postsynaptically mediated and highly localized to Arc-expressing neurons. Taken together, our findings validate the immediate-early gene Arc as a molecular marker for the LA neuronal ensemble recruited during fear learning. Moreover, these results establish a model of fear memory formation in which intrinsic excitability determines neuronal selection, whereas learning-related encoding is governed by synaptic plasticity.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 24 March 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.18.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the risk of multiple recurrences after an initial seizure recurrence in childhood. In a prospective study, 407 children were followed for a mean of 9.6 years from the time of their first unprovoked seizure. Data regarding each seizure recurrence were obtained and analyzed using statistical methods for survival analysis. The cumulative risk of a second seizure was 29\%, 37\%, 43\%, and 46\% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Of the 182 children who experienced a second seizure, 131 (72\%) experienced a third seizure, 105 (58\%) have had 4 or more seizures, and 52 (29\%) have experienced 10 or more seizures. The cumulative risk of a third seizure was 57\%, 63\%, and 71\% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively, after the second seizure. After a third seizure, the cumulative risk of another seizure was 69\%, 72\%, and 81\% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. After a second seizure, factors associated with an increased risk of additional recurrences included a remote symptomatic etiology (rate ratio = 1.7) and the occurrence of a second seizure within 6 months of the first seizure (rate ratio = 1.7). After a second seizure, the risk of subsequent seizures was greater than 50\% even in the lowest risk group. With the exception of etiology, factors associated with an increased risk of multiple recurrences after the initial seizure were different than those associated with multiple recurrences after a second seizure. Factors associated with multiple recurrent seizures may be different than those associated with an initial recurrence. As most patients who experience a second seizure experience further seizures, these data suggest that two seizures are a sufficient epidemiological criterion for the definition of epilepsy.

  shorttitle = {Relationships of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the elderly with functional, psychological, and mental status, and short-term mortality},
  abstract = {In human beings of both sexes, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) circulating in blood is mostly an adrenally secreted steroid whose serum concentration (in the micromolar range and 30-50\% higher in men than in women) decreases with age, toward approximately 20-10\% of its value in young adults during the 8th and 9th decades. The mechanism of action of DHEA and DHEAS is poorly known and may include partial transformation into sex steroids, increase of bioavailable insulin-like growth factor 1, and effects on neurotransmitter receptors. Whether there is a cause-to-effect relationship between the decreasing levels of DHEAS with age and physiological and pathological manifestations of aging is still undecided, but this is of obvious theoretical and practical interest in view of the easy restoration by DHEA administration. Here we report on 622 subjects over 65 years of age, studied for the 4 years since DHEAS baseline values had been obtained, in the frame of the PAQUID program, analyzing the functional, psychological, and mental status of a community-based population in the south-west of France. We confirm the continuing decrease of DHEAS serum concentration with age, more in men than in women, even if men retain higher levels. Significantly lower values of baseline DHEAS were recorded in women in cases of functional limitation (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), confinement, dyspnea, depressive symptomatology, poor subjective perception of health and life satisfaction, and usage of various medications. In men, there was a trend for the same correlations, even though not statistically significant in most categories. No differences in DHEAS levels were found in cases of incident dementia in the following 4 years. In men (but not in women), lower DHEAS was significantly associated with increased short-term mortality at 2 and 4 years after baseline measurement. These results, statistically established by taking into account corrections for age, sex, and health indicators, suggest the need for further careful trials of the administration of replacement doses of DHEA in aging humans. Indeed, the first noted results of such "treatment" are consistent with correlations observed here between functional and psychological status and endogenous steroid serum concentrations.},

We present evidence that neuronal structural changes, i.e., dendritic spine growth, develop sequentially in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (aCC) during the formation of recent and remote contextual fear memory. We found that mice placed in a conditioning chamber for one 7 min conditioning session and exposed to five footshocks (duration, 2 s; intensity, 0.7 mA; interstimulus interval, 60 s) delivered through the grid floor exhibited robust fear response when returned to the experimental context 24 h or 36 d after the conditioning. We then observed that their fear response at the recent, but not the remote, time point was associated with an increase in spine density on hippocampal neurons, whereas an inverse temporal pattern of spine density changes occurred on aCC neurons. At each time point, hippocampal or aCC structural alterations were achieved even in the absence of recent or remote memory tests, thus suggesting that they were not driven by retrieval processes. Furthermore, ibotenic lesions of the hippocampus impaired remote memory and prevented dendritic spine growth on aCC neurons when they were performed immediately after the conditioning, whereas they were ineffective when performed 24 d later. These findings reveal that gradual structural changes modifying connectivity in hippocampal\textendash{}cortical networks underlie the formation and expression of remote memory, and that the hippocampus plays a crucial but time-limited role in driving structural plasticity in the cortex.},

  abstract = {The idea that humans use flexible map-like representations of their environment to guide spatial navigation has a long and controversial history. One reason for this enduring controversy might be that individuals vary considerably in their ability to form and utilize cognitive maps. Here we investigate the behavioral and neuroanatomical signatures of these individual differences. Participants learned an unfamiliar campus environment over a period of three weeks. In their first visit, they learned the position of different buildings along two routes in separate areas of the campus. During the following weeks, they learned these routes for a second and third time, along with two paths that connected both areas of the campus. Behavioral assessments after each learning session indicated that subjects formed a coherent representation of the spatial structure of the entire campus after learning a single connecting path. Volumetric analyses of structural MRI data and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) indicated that the size of the right posterior hippocampus predicted the ability to use this spatial knowledge to make inferences about the relative positions of different buildings on the campus. An inverse relationship between gray matter volume and performance was observed in the caudate. These results suggest that (i) humans can rapidly acquire cognitive maps of large-scale environments and (ii) individual differences in hippocampal anatomy may provide the neuroanatomical substrate for individual differences in the ability to learn and flexibly use these cognitive maps.

However, latency period between febrile seizure and the onset of the first spontaneous seizure has not been evaluated. The present study was designed to investigate the susceptibility to subsequent seizures in immature rats that had experienced early-life hyperthermic seizures and before they achieved the adult age. The results were compared with those induced by hyperthermia alone. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was applied 24 h or 20 days after hyperthermic seizures or hyperthermia were induced in 10-day-old rats by a regulated stream of moderately heated air. One day after hyperthermic seizures or hyperthermia, animals demonstrated enhanced latency to the PTZ-induced myoclonic (88\% and 53\%, respectively), clonic (60\% and 60\%, respectively) and tonic seizures (233\% and 659\%, respectively). The incidence of myoclonic and clonic seizures was similar to that in control group (100\%). However, hyperthermic seizures reduced (50\%) the incidence of tonic seizures. Twenty days after hyperthermic seizures there was an augmented latency to tonic seizures (123\%) and reduced incidence for all the PTZ-induced seizures (71\% myoclonic; 71\% clonic seizures; 57\% tonic seizures) when compared with control group (100\%). In contrast, hyperthermia enhanced only the latency to myoclonic (133\%) and clonic seizures (659\%). Our data indicate that hyperthermic seizures or hyperthermia induces a protective effect against PTZ-induced seizures during a latency period.

Currently AD is diagnosed through longitudinal clinical evaluations, which are available only at specialized dementia clinics, hence beyond financial and geographic reach of most patients. Automated diagnosis tools that can be made available to community hospitals would therefore be very beneficial. To that end, we have previously shown that the event related potentials obtained from different scalp locations can be effectively used for early diagnosis of AD using an ensemble of classifiers based decision fusion approach. In this study, we expand our data fusion approach to include MRI based measures of regional brain atrophy.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that years of formal education modifies the relation of AD pathology to level of cognitive function.
METHODS: A total of 130 older Catholic clergy participating in the Religious Orders Study underwent annual cognitive function testing and brain autopsy at the time of death. Individual cognitive function tests were z-scored and averaged to yield a global measure of cognitive function and summary measures of five different cognitive abilities. Neuritic and diffuse plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were counted in separate 1 mm(2) areas of maximal density. Counts were converted to standard scores by dividing by their SD, and combined to yield a global AD pathology score and summary scores of each postmortem index. Linear regression was used to examine the relation of education and AD pathology scores to level of cognitive function proximate to death, controlling for age and sex. Subsequent analyses tested the interaction between education and each AD pathology score to determine whether education modified the relation of AD pathology to level of cognitive function. Additional analyses examined these associations on five specific cognitive abilities.
RESULTS: Both years of formal education (regression coefficient = 0.073, p = 0.0001) and the global AD pathology score (regression coefficient = -0.689, p \ensuremath{<} 0.0001) were related to level of cognitive function. When an interaction term between education and AD pathology was added to the model, the association between a unit of AD pathology and level of cognitive function was 0.088 (p = 0.0078) standard unit less for each year of education than the level predicted from the model without the interaction term. Whereas neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles were all strongly related to cognitive function, education only modified the relation of neuritic plaques (p = 0.002) and diffuse plaques (p = 0.03) to cognition, but not neurofibrillary tangles. In analyses examining five different cognitive abilities, the interaction between education and the neuritic plaque score was strongest for perceptual speed and weakest for episodic memory.
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide strong evidence that the relation between senile plaques and level of cognitive function differs by years of formal education.},

Reconsolidation is a nearly universal phenomenon, occurring in a diverse array of species and learning tasks. The function of reconsolidation remains unclear but it has been proposed as a mechanism for updating or strengthening memories. Observations of an analog of reconsolidation in vitro and in sensory systems indicate that reconsolidation is unlikely to be a learning-specific phenomenon and may serve a broader function. We propose that reconsolidation arises from the activity-dependent induction of two coincident but opposing processes: the depotentiation and repotentiation of strengthened synapses. These processes suggest that reconsolidation reflects a fundamental mechanism that regulates and preserves synaptic strength.},

In a functional magnetic resonance study we originally characterized and contrasted FA and OM meditation forms within the same experiment, by an integrated FA-OM design. Theravada Buddhist monks, expert in both FA and OM meditation forms, and lay novices with 10 days of meditation practice, participated in the experiment. Our evidence suggests that expert meditators control cognitive engagement in conscious processing of sensory-related, thought and emotion contents, by massive self-regulation of fronto-parietal and insular areas in the left hemisphere, in a meditation state-dependent fashion. We also found that anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices play antagonist roles in the executive control of the attention setting in meditation tasks. Our findings resolve the controversy between the hypothesis that meditative states are associated to transient hypofrontality or deactivation of executive brain areas, and evidence about the activation of executive brain areas in meditation. Finally, our study suggests that a functional reorganization of brain activity patterns for focused attention and cognitive monitoring takes place with mental practice, and that meditation-related neuroplasticity is crucially associated to a functional reorganization of activity patterns in prefrontal cortex and in the insula.},

This phenomenon has been named kindling antagonism. In this report, we present data indicating that kindling antagonism does not occur in 16-day-old rats. Instead, 16-day-old rats receiving alternating stimulations in the amygdala and hippocampus develop progressively more severe seizures. Kindling with alternate stimulations is elicited at a much faster rate at the two foci compared to kindling from a single site, either the hippocampus or amygdala. All groups develop generalized seizures including seizure stages 6 and 7, consisting of wild jumping, running with vocalizations and tonus. These seizures appear after relatively few stimulations in the pup, in comparison to the adult. The results indicate that the immature brain is less able to suppress the generalization of seizures than the adult. The age-specific enhanced development of bilateral foci may be due to underdeveloped inhibitory systems and may underlie the propensity of the immature CNS to develop multifocal seizures.},

Expert performance levels can be achieved with well-organized knowledge, using sophisticated and specific mental representations and cognitive processing, applying automatic sequences quickly and efficiently, being able to deal with large amounts of information, and many other challenging task demands and situations that otherwise paralyze the performance of novices. The neural reorganizations that occur with expertise reflect the optimization of the neurocognitive resources to deal with the complex computational load needed to achieve peak performance. As such, capitalizing on neuronal plasticity, brain modifications take place over time-practice and during the consolidation process. One major challenge is to investigate the neural substrates and cognitive mechanisms engaged in expertise, and to define ``expertise'' from its neural and cognitive underpinnings. Recent insights showed that many brain structures are recruited during task performance, but only activity in regions related to domain-specific knowledge distinguishes experts from novices. The present review focuses on three expertise domains placed across a motor to mental gradient of skill learning: sequential motor skill, mental simulation of the movement (motor imagery), and meditation as a paradigmatic example of ``pure'' mental training. We first describe results on each specific domain from the initial skill acquisition to expert performance, including recent results on the corresponding underlying neural mechanisms. We then discuss differences and similarities between these domains with the aim to identify the highlights of the neurocognitive processes underpinning expertise, and conclude with suggestions for future research.},

Here we show that hippocampal synapses potentiate robustly in response to strong activation by a single burst. The induction mechanism of this single-burst LTP requires activation of NMDA receptors, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and dendritic spikes. Thus, dendritic spikes are a critical trigger for a form of LTP that is consistent with the function of the hippocampus in episodic memory.},

The central amygdala (CeA), once viewed as a passive relay between the amygdala complex and downstream fear effectors, has emerged as an active participant in fear conditioning. However, the mechanism by which CeA contributes to the learning and expression of fear is unclear. We found that fear conditioning in mice induced robust plasticity of excitatory synapses onto inhibitory neurons in the lateral subdivision of the CeA (CeL). This experience-dependent plasticity was cell specific, bidirectional and expressed presynaptically by inputs from the lateral amygdala. In particular, preventing synaptic potentiation onto somatostatin-positive neurons impaired fear memory formation. Furthermore, activation of these neurons was necessary for fear memory recall and was sufficient to drive fear responses. Our findings support a model in which fear conditioning-induced synaptic modifications in CeL favor the activation of somatostatin-positive neurons, which inhibit CeL output, thereby disinhibiting the medial subdivision of CeA and releasing fear expression.},

This VBM study examined brain changes related to the practice of an emotion-oriented meditation: loving-kindness meditation (LKM). A 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner captured images of the brain structures of 25 men, 10 of whom had practiced LKM in the Theravada tradition for at least 5 years. Compared with novices, more gray matter volume was detected in the right angular and posterior parahippocampal gyri in LKM experts. The right angular gyrus has not been previously reported to have structural differences associated with meditation, and its specific role in mind and cognitive empathy theory suggests the uniqueness of this finding for LKM practice. These regions are important for affective regulation associated with empathic response, anxiety and mood. At the same time, gray matter volume in the left temporal lobe in the LKM experts appeared to be greater, an observation that has also been reported in previous MRI meditation studies on meditation styles other than LKM. Overall, the findings of our study suggest that experience in LKM may influence brain structures associated with affective regulation.},

Naloxone must be present during shock, nor just during the observation period, in order to increase freezing (Experiment 6). These results suggest that when an animal is shocked, it releases endogenous analgesics (endorphins) that make a subsequent shock less aversive.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spatial distribution of the magnitude and direction of the current density in the human head during transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).
METHODS: The current density distribution was calculated using a numerical method to implement a standard spherical head model into which current was injected by means of large electrodes. The model was positioned in 'MNI space' to facilitate the interpretation of spatial coordinates.
RESULTS: The magnitude and direction of the current density vector are illustrated in selected brain slices for four different electrode montages. Approximately half of the current injected during tDCS is shunted through the scalp, depending on electrode dimension and position. Using stimulating currents of 2.0 mA, the magnitude of the current density in relevant regions of the brain is of the order of 0.1 A/m2, corresponding to an electric field of 0.22 V/m.
CONCLUSIONS: Calculations based on a spherical model of the head can provide useful information about the magnitude and direction of the current density vector in the brain during tDCS, taking into account the geometry and position of the electrodes. Despite the inherent limitations of the spherical head model, the calculated values are comparable to those used in the most recent in vitro studies on modulation of neuronal activity.
SIGNIFICANCE: The methodology presented in this paper may be used to assess the current distribution during tDCS using new electrode montages, to help optimize montages that target a specific region of the brain or to preliminarily investigate compliance with safety guidelines.},

  abstract = {Switching between exploratory and defensive behaviour is fundamental to survival of many animals, but how this transition is achieved by specific neuronal circuits is not known. Here, using the converse behavioural states of fear extinction and its context-dependent renewal as a model in mice, we show that bi-directional transitions between states of high and low fear are triggered by a rapid switch in the balance of activity between two distinct populations of basal amygdala neurons. These two populations are integrated into discrete neuronal circuits differentially connected with the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Targeted and reversible neuronal inactivation of the basal amygdala prevents behavioural changes without affecting memory or expression of behaviour. Our findings indicate that switching between distinct behavioural states can be triggered by selective activation of specific neuronal circuits integrating sensory and contextual information. These observations provide a new framework for understanding context-dependent changes of fear behaviour.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms that contribute to selective vulnerability of the magnocellular basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, are not fully understood. Because age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, mechanisms of interest must include age-related alterations in protein expression, cell type-specific markers and pathology. The present study explored the extent and characteristics of intraneuronal amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} accumulation, particularly of the fibrillogenic 42-amino acid isoform, within basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in normal young, normal aged and Alzheimer's disease brains as a potential contributor to the selective vulnerability of these neurons using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta}1\textendash{}42 immunoreactivity was observed in the entire cholinergic neuronal population regardless of age or Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. The magnitude of this accumulation as revealed by optical density measures was significantly greater than that in cortical pyramidal neurons, and magnocellular neurons in the globus pallidus did not demonstrate a similar extent of amyloid immunoreactivity. Immunoblot analysis with a panel of amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} antibodies confirmed accumulation of high concentration of amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} in basal forebrain early in adult life. There was no age- or Alzheimer-related alteration in total amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} content within this region. In contrast, an increase in the large molecular weight soluble oligomer species was observed with a highly oligomer-specific antibody in aged and Alzheimer brains when compared with the young. Similarly, intermediate molecular weight oligomeric species displayed an increase in aged and Alzheimer brains when compared with the young using two amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta}42 antibodies. Compared to cortical homogenates, small molecular weight oligomeric species were lower and intermediate species were enriched in basal forebrain in ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Regional and age-related differences in accumulation were not the result of alterations in expression of the amyloid precursor protein, as confirmed by both immunostaining and western blot. Our results demonstrate that intraneuronal amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} accumulation is a relatively selective trait of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons early in adult life, and increases in the prevalence of intermediate and large oligomeric assembly states are associated with both ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Selective intraneuronal amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} accumulation in adult life and oligomerization during the ageing process are potential contributors to the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a complex disease with diverse clinical characteristics that preclude a singular mechanism. One way to gain insight into potential mechanisms is to reduce the features of epilepsy to its basic components: seizures, epileptogenesis, and the state of recurrent unprovoked seizures that defines epilepsy itself. A common way to explain seizures in a normal individual is that a disruption has occurred in the normal balance of excitation and inhibition. The fact that multiple mechanisms exist is not surprising given the varied ways the normal nervous system controls this balance. In contrast, understanding seizures in the brain of an individual with epilepsy is more difficult because seizures are typically superimposed on an altered nervous system. The different environment includes diverse changes, making mechanistic predictions a challenge. Understanding the mechanisms of seizures in an individual with epilepsy is also more complex than understanding the mechanisms of seizures in a normal individual because epilepsy is not necessarily a static condition but can continue to evolve over the lifespan. Using temporal lobe epilepsy as an example, it is clear that genes, developmental mechanisms, and neuronal plasticity play major roles in creating a state of underlying hyperexcitability. However, the critical control points for the emergence of chronic seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as their persistence, frequency, and severity, are questions that remain unresolved.},

Bi-directional transmission of reward signals through this GABAA receptor substrate is dynamically controlled by the opiate state of the organism and involves a molecular alteration of the GABAA receptor.

Experiment 1 induced moods via video and induction of an unhappy mood was associated with a greater tendency for past-related mind wandering as measured by a post-task questionnaire. In Experiment 2, negative and positive moods were induced in a group of participants using the Velten mood-induction procedure and the temporal focus of mind wandering was measured using experience sampling probes. Analyses indicated that induction of an unhappy mood led to an increase in past-related mind wandering and the magnitude of this change increased with scores on a measure of depressive symptoms. Together these experiments suggest that when the mind wanders in an unhappy mood it is drawn to events from its past.},

In the current study, the authors trained older adults in a real-time strategy video game for 23.5 hr in an effort to improve their executive functions. A battery of cognitive tasks, including tasks of executive control and visuospatial skills, were assessed before, during, and after video-game training. The trainees improved significantly in the measures of game performance. They also improved significantly more than the control participants in executive control functions, such as task switching, working memory, visual short-term memory, and reasoning. Individual differences in changes in game performance were correlated with improvements in task switching. The study has implications for the enhancement of executive control processes of older adults.},

  volume = {81},
  issn = {0306-4522},
  abstract = {Persistent hyperexcitability follows synchronized bursting induced in the CA3 region of hippocampal slices by perfusion with high concentrations (2000 IU/ml) of the GABAA antagonist, penicillin. This hyperexcitable state is characterized by: i) slow recovery from bursting following penicillin washout; ii) persistent "post-burst" field potential oscillations and iii) increased probability of spontaneous bursting with ordinarily sub-convulsant doses of GABAA antagonists. An N-methyl-D-aspartate-independent type of long-term potentiation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate excitatory postsynaptic potentials occurred following bursting. However, similar increases in excitatory postsynaptic potential magnitude also occurred after a subconvulsant dose of penicillin (500 IU/ml) which did not produce the other features of persistent hyperexcitability. Furthermore, long-term potentiation either increased or remained stable after bursting stopped, whereas, post-burst oscillations gradually diminished with time. Low doses of the AMPA/kainate antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, which restored the potentiated excitatory postsynaptic potentials to control levels, reduced but did not eliminate the post-burst oscillation. Tetanus-induced long-term potentiation did not reproduce the hyperexcitable state seen after bursting. These findings indicate that the epileptiform bursting caused by blocking GABAA-mediated inhibition induces long-term potentiation which is partially responsible for persistent burst-induced hyperexcitability but is not sufficient to entirely explain it. The hippocampus which is critical for normal memory is also frequently the generator of intractable epileptic seizures. Seizure-like discharges in the hippocampus induced long-lasting increases in synaptic efficacy similar to those thought to underlie normal memory. This form of long-term potentiation contributed to the network oscillations characteristics of the hyperexcitable state persisting after epileptiform activity but was not sufficient to entirely explain them. Epileptic seizures may engage normal memory mechanisms which increase neuronal excitability and predispose the hippocampal network to further seizures. This may, in part, account for the propensity for hippocampal seizure foci to become intractable.},

Methods: Three groups of subjects aged 20\textendash{}64 were studied: 44 major depressives, 35 subjects with partially or completely remitted depression, matched as far as possible for age and drug treatment, and 41 normal control subjects. Dehydroepiandrosterone and cortisol in saliva were determined from specimens taken at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm on 4 days. Results: The mean age of the three groups did not differ. Dehydroepiandrosterone was lowered at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm compared with control subjects. Values for the remitted group were intermediate. Dehydroepiandrosterone levels at 8:00 am correlated negatively with severity of depression and were not related to drug treatment or smoking, but decreased with age (as expected). Cortisol was elevated in depression in the evening. The molar cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone ratio also differentiated those with depression from the control group. Conclusions: Lowered dehydroepiandrosterone levels are an additional state abnormality in adult depression. Adrenal steroid changes are thus not limited to cortisol. Because dehydroepiandrosterone may antagonize some effects of cortisol and may have mood improving properties, these findings may have significant implications for the pathophysiology of depression.},

Although RR elicitation is an effective therapeutic intervention that counteracts the adverse clinical effects of stress in disorders including hypertension, anxiety, insomnia and aging, the underlying molecular mechanisms that explain these clinical benefits remain undetermined. To assess rapid time-dependent (temporal) genomic changes during one session of RR practice among healthy practitioners with years of RR practice and also in novices before and after 8 weeks of RR training, we measured the transcriptome in peripheral blood prior to, immediately after, and 15 minutes after listening to an RR-eliciting or a health education CD. Both short-term and long-term practitioners evoked significant temporal gene expression changes with greater significance in the latter as compared to novices. RR practice enhanced expression of genes associated with energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, insulin secretion and telomere maintenance, and reduced expression of genes linked to inflammatory response and stress-related pathways. Interactive network analyses of RR-affected pathways identified mitochondrial ATP synthase and insulin (INS) as top upregulated critical molecules (focus hubs) and NF-\ensuremath{\kappa}B pathway genes as top downregulated focus hubs. Our results for the first time indicate that RR elicitation, particularly after long-term practice, may evoke its downstream health benefits by improving mitochondrial energy production and utilization and thus promoting mitochondrial resiliency through upregulation of ATPase and insulin function. Mitochondrial resiliency might also be promoted by RR-induced downregulation of NF-\ensuremath{\kappa}B-associated upstream and downstream targets that mitigates stress.},

Seizure thresholds for clonic and tonic-clonic electrically induced seizures did not differ between brain-derived neurotrophic factor wild-type and heterozygous mice. However, heterozygous mice had higher thresholds for 6 Hz limbic seizures compared with wild-type mice. Heterozygous mice also required larger doses of kainate to produce limbic seizures. Somewhat surprisingly, heterozygous mice required significantly lower doses of pilocarpine to produce limbic seizures. However, heterozygous mice required a higher dose of pentylenetetrazol to induce twitches, but not clonic seizures, compared with wild-type mice. In addition, heterozygous mice required more current to elicit focal afterdischarges in the amygdala both pre- and post-kindling than did wild-type mice, and, heterozygous mice kindled more slowly than wild-type mice. The present findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that brain-derived neurotrophic factor is involved not only in normal excitability, but may also be involved in abnormal excitability such as occurs in seizure disorders and epileptogenesis.},

  abstract = {Long-lasting modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability in cortical neurons underlies distinct stages of skill learning. However, whether individual differences in learning capabilities are dependent on the rate by which such learning-induced modifications occur has yet to be explored. Here we show that training rats in a simple olfactory-discrimination task results in the same enhanced excitability in piriform cortex neurons as previously shown after training in a much more complex olfactory-discrimination task. Based on their learning capabilities in the simple task, rats could be divided to two groups: fast performers and slow performers. The rate at which rats accomplished the skill to perform the simple task was correlated with the time course at which piriform cortex neurons increased their repetitive spike firing. Twelve hours after learning, neurons from fast performers had reduced spike frequency adaptation as compared with neurons from slow performers and controls. Three days after learning, spike frequency adaptation was reduced in neurons from SP, while neurons from fast performers increased their spike firing adaptation to the level of controls. Accordingly, the post-burst AHP was reduced in neurons from fast performers 12 h after learning and in neurons from slow performers 3 days after learning. Moreover, the differences in learning capabilities between fast performers and slow performers were maintained when examined in a different, complex olfactory-discrimination task. We suggest that the rate at which neuronal excitability is modified during learning may affect the behavioral flexibility of the animal.},

These mechanisms have been targeted to prevent epileptogenesis in animal models. Favourable effects have been obtained using immunosuppressants, antibodies blocking adhesion of leucocytes to endothelial cells, gene therapy driving expression of neurotrophic factors, pharmacological neurostimulation, or even with conventional antiepileptic drugs by administering them before the appearance of genetic epilepsy. Further studies are needed to clarify the optimum time window and aetiological specificity of treatments. Questions related to adverse events also need further consideration. Encouragingly, the recent experimental studies emphasise that the complicated process of epileptogenesis can be favourably modified, and that antiepileptogenesis as a treatment indication might not be an impossible mission.},

  abstract = {After acquisition, memories associated with contextual fear conditioning pass through a labile phase, in which they are vulnerable to hippocampal lesions, to a more stable state, via consolidation, in which they engage extrahippocampal structures and are resistant to such disruption. The process is accompanied by changes in the form of the memory from being context-specific to context-general. However, when revived by a reminder, stable memories once again become labile and susceptible to hippocampal disruption, and memory reconsolidation is needed to stabilize them. This study addressed two questions with respect to this reconsolidation phenomenon: (1) How do reminders reinstate a hippocampally dependent memory trace? (2) As the memory changes from a stable to a labile state after a reminder, does its form remain invariant, or does it also change? Using contextual manipulations at retrieval in a test of contextual fear conditioning, we showed that when the fear-conditioning environment served as a reminder, the reinstated memory regained its context specificity and, as a result, became vulnerable again to the effects of hippocampal lesions. By comparison, exposure to a different environment during the reminder session reinstated a version of the original memory that was dependent primarily on general features of the original context and, consequently, was less affected by hippocampal lesions. These findings, which relate loss of reactivated memories after hippocampal destruction (or inactivation) to changes in memory representation, are interpreted as consistent with the transformation hypothesis of memory processing.},

  abstract = {Hyperactivity within the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) has been linked to both psychosis in humans and behavioral deficits in animal models of schizophrenia. A local decrease in GABA-mediated inhibition, particularly involving parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABA neurons, has been proposed as a key mechanism underlying this hyperactive state. However, direct evidence is lacking for a causal role of vHPC GABA neurons in behaviors associated with schizophrenia. Here, we probed the behavioral function of two different but overlapping populations of vHPC GABA neurons that express either PV or GAD65 by selectively inhibiting these neurons with the pharmacogenetic neuromodulator hM4D. We show that acute inhibition of vHPC GABA neurons in adult mice results in behavioral changes relevant to schizophrenia. Inhibiting either PV or GAD65 neurons produced distinct behavioral deficits. Inhibition of PV neurons, affecting \ensuremath{\sim}80\% of the PV neuron population, robustly impaired prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (PPI), startle reactivity, and spontaneous alternation, but did not affect locomotor activity. In contrast, inhibiting a heterogeneous population of GAD65 neurons, affecting \ensuremath{\sim}40\% of PV neurons and 65\% of cholecystokinin neurons, increased spontaneous and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and reduced spontaneous alternation, but did not alter PPI. Inhibition of PV or GAD65 neurons also produced distinct changes in network oscillatory activity in the vHPC in vivo. Together, these findings establish a causal role for vHPC GABA neurons in controlling behaviors relevant to schizophrenia and suggest a functional dissociation between the GABAergic mechanisms involved in hippocampal modulation of sensorimotor processes.},

To clarify the role of CREB in memory, we used a paradigm, conditioned taste avoidance, that places few performance demands on the subject.

Furthermore, either chronically or acutely disrupting CREB function in two different types of genetically modified mice blocks memory for conditioned taste aversion measured 24 h following training.

  abstract = {The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei controlling voluntary actions and have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). The prevailing model of basal ganglia function states that two circuits, the direct and indirect pathways, originate from distinct populations of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and project to different output structures. These circuits are believed to have opposite effects on movement. Specifically, the activity of direct pathway MSNs is postulated to promote movement, whereas the activation of indirect pathway MSNs is hypothesized to inhibit it. Recent findings have revealed that this model might not fully account for the concurrent activation of both pathways during movement. Accordingly, we propose a model in which intrastriatal connections are critical and the two pathways are structurally and functionally intertwined. Thus, all MSNs might either facilitate or inhibit movement depending on the form of synaptic plasticity expressed at a certain moment. In PD, alterations of dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity could alter this coordinated activity.

  abstract = {Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) regulates numerous gene expression programs through its signal-dependent repression of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and serum response factor (SRF) transcription factors. In cardiomyocytes, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling promotes hypertrophy and pathological remodeling, at least in part by phosphorylating HDAC4, with consequent stimulation of MEF2 activity. In this paper, we describe a novel mechanism whereby protein kinase A (PKA) overcomes CaMKII-mediated activation of MEF2 by regulated proteolysis of HDAC4. PKA induces the generation of an N-terminal HDAC4 cleavage product (HDAC4-NT). HDAC4-NT selectively inhibits activity of MEF2 but not SRF, thereby antagonizing the prohypertrophic actions of CaMKII signaling without affecting cardiomyocyte survival. Thus, HDAC4 functions as a molecular nexus for the antagonistic actions of the CaMKII and PKA pathways. These findings have implications for understanding the molecular basis of cardioprotection and other cellular processes in which CaMKII and PKA exert opposing effects.},

  abstract = {Cellular autofluorescence can affect the sensitivity of fluorescence microscopic or flow cytometric assays by interfering with or even precluding the detection of low-level specific fluorescence. Here we developed a method to detect and quantify bacterial autofluorescence in the green region of the spectrum at the single-cell level using a laboratory-built high-sensitivity flow cytometer (HSFCM). The detection of the very weak bacterial autofluorescence was confirmed by analyzing polystyrene beads of comparable and larger size than bacteria in parallel. Dithionite reduction and air re-exposure experiments verified that the green autofluorescence mainly originates from endogenous flavins. Bacterial autofluorescence was quantified by calibrating the fluorescence intensity of nanospheres with known FITC equivalents, and autofluorescence distribution was generated by analyzing thousands of bacterial cells in 1 min. Among the eight bacterial strains tested, it was found that bacterial autofluorescence can vary from 80 to 1400 FITC equivalents per cell, depending on the bacterial species, and a relatively large cell-to-cell variation in autofluorescence intensity was observed. Quantitative measurements of bacterial autofluorescence provide a reference for the background signals that can be expected with bacteria, which is important in guiding studies of low-level gene expression and for the detection of low-abundance biological molecules in individual bacterial cells. This paper presents the first quantification of bacterial autofluorescence in FITC equivalents.},

In dual whole-cell voltage recordings from pyramidal neurons, the coincidence of postsynaptic action potentials (APs) and unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was found to induce changes in EPSPs. Their average amplitudes were differentially up- or down-regulated, depending on the precise timing of postsynaptic APs relative to EPSPs. These observations suggest that APs propagating back into dendrites serve to modify single active synaptic connections, depending on the pattern of electrical activity in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons.},

Neurons were characterized by electrotonic and electrogenic parameters. Cytoplasm was collected from individual neurons, and single-cell RT-PCR was used for detection of molecular markers typifying LA interneurons. Hierarchical cluster and multiple discriminant analysis demonstrated the existence of five types of GABAergic interneurons, which can be reliably identified through electrophysiological criteria. Action potentials were of a short duration followed by pronounced fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in interneurons of all types, except for type V, which generated broad action potentials and displayed typical spike bursts at the beginning of depolarizing stimuli and prominent anomalous inward rectification. Interneurons of type I and II generated series of action potentials with frequency adaptation on maintained depolarizing current stimulation with overall frequencies at high levels and presented delayed firing, stuttering or fast-spiking behavior. Further distinguishing features of type II interneurons were a medium AHP following spike trains and pronounced anomalous inward rectification. Types III and IV of neurons fired regularly, whereas type IV displayed no prominent spike frequency adaptation. Additionally, interneurons of all five types contained mRNA of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and cholecystokinin, whereas only type I interneurons were somatostatin-positive. Overall, these data represent a detailed and reliable classification scheme of LA GABAergic interneurons and will provide a feasible basis for subsequent functional studies.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: A deregulation in concentrations of the neurosteroids (allo)pregnanolone and 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3alpha,5alpha-TH DOC) has been found in depressed patients. These levels normalize following treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Furthermore, administration of the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to depressed patients is associated with an improvement in the symptoms of depression.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present review is to clarify the mechanisms whereby neurosteroids, particularly allopregnanolone and DHEA, are involved in depression and to discuss the effect of SSRIs on allopregnanolone concentration.
METHODS: Literature on preclinical and clinical research has been analyzed in relation to the pathophysiology of depression.
RESULTS: Decreased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of allopregnanolone in depressed patients increase to normal levels following effective psychopharmacological treatment. This might either be a physiological aspect of improvement in the symptoms of depression or a pharmacologically induced alteration. Several findings support the hypothesis of an antidepressant effect of allopregnanolone. These include an antidepressant effect demonstrated in an animal model of depression and a suppressing effect on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) gene expression. SSRIs increase levels of allopregnanolone, but this effect is not confined to this class of drugs alone. The beneficial effect of DHEA administration in depressed patients might result from its sigma 1 receptor-mediated enhancement of noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmission, antiglucocorticoid effects, and cognition enhancing effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Indirect genomic (allopregnanolone) and non-genomic (allopregnanolone and DHEA) mechanisms are involved in the neurosteroidogenic pathophysiology of depression. Clinical studies in homogeneous groups of non-pharmacologically treated depressed patients are required to elucidate this relationship further.},

  abstract = {Two semi-synthetic acetyl-derivatives of the alkaloid sauroine from Huperzia saururus, Monoacetyl sauroine (MAS) and diacetyl sauroine (DAS), were obtained and their chemical structures were analyzed by NMR. While MAS is the typical product of acetylation, DAS is an unexpected derivative related to the keto-enol formation of sauroine. Recordings of field EPSPs from the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices showed that only DAS acutely applied induced chemical Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 1.15\ensuremath{\pm}0.09 \ensuremath{\mu}M. This effect was blocked by 10 \ensuremath{\mu}M D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5), suggesting dependence on the NMDA receptor. DAS significantly increased NMDA receptor-dependent EPSCs without affecting AMPA receptor-dependent currents. Repetitive administration of DAS improved visuo-spatial learning in the Morris Water Maze (MWM). In slices from rats tested in the MWM, LTP resulting from electrical synaptic stimulation was 2.5 times larger than in controls. Concentration of DAS measured in the brain after repetitive administration was 29.5 \ensuremath{\mu}M. We conclude that slices perfused with DAS display a robust NMDA receptor-dependent chemical LTP. During chronic treatment, DAS enhances learning abilities through a metaplastic mechanism as revealed by the augmentation of LTP in slices. DAS, therefore, may be a promising compound as a nootropic therapeutic drug. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal configurations of distributed activity in the brain is thought to contribute to the coding of neuronal information and synaptic contacts between nerve cells could play a central role in the formation of privileged pathways of activity. Synaptic plasticity is not the exclusive mode of regulation of information processing in the brain, and persistent regulations of ionic conductances in some specialized neuronal areas such as the dendrites, the cell body, and the axon could also modulate, in the long-term, the propagation of neuronal information. Persistent changes in intrinsic excitability have been reported in several brain areas in which activity is elevated during a classical conditioning. The role of synaptic activity seems to be a determinant in the induction, but the learning rules and the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. We discuss here the role of synaptic activity in the induction of intrinsic plasticity in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar neurons. Activation of glutamate receptors initiates a long-term modification in neuronal excitability that may represent a parallel, synergistic substrate for learning and memory. Similar to synaptic plasticity, long-lasting intrinsic plasticity appears to be bidirectional and to express a certain level of input or cell specificity. These nonsynaptic forms of plasticity affect the signal propagation in the axon, the dendrites, and the soma. They not only share common learning rules and induction pathways with the better-known synaptic plasticity such as NMDA receptor dependent LTP and LTD, but also contribute in synergy with these synaptic changes to the formation of a coherent engram.},

  abstract = {Fear conditioning and extinction are behavioral models that reflect the association and dissociation of environmental cues to aversive outcomes, both known to involve the lateral amygdala (LA). Accordingly, responses of LA neurons to conditioned stimuli (CS) increase after fear conditioning and decrease partially during extinction. However, the long-term effects of repeated fear conditioning and extinction on LA neuronal firing have not been explored. Here we show, using stable, high signal-to-noise ratio single-unit recordings, that the ensemble activity of all recorded LA neurons correlates tightly with conditioned fear responses of rats in a conditioning/extinction/reconditioning paradigm spanning 3 d. This CS-evoked ensemble activity increased after conditioning, decreased after extinction, and was repotentiated after reconditioning. Cell-by-cell analysis revealed that among the LA neurons that displayed potentiated responses after initial fear conditioning, some exhibited weakened CS responses after extinction (extinction-susceptible), whereas others remained potentiated (extinction-resistant). The majority of extinction-susceptible neurons exhibited strong potentiation after reconditioning, suggesting that this distinct subpopulation (reversible fear neurons) encodes updated CS\textendash{}unconditioned stimulus (US) association strength. Interestingly, these reversible fear neurons displayed larger, more rapid potentiation during reconditioning compared with the initial conditioning, providing a neural correlate of savings after extinction. In contrast, the extinction-resistant fear neurons did not show further increases after reconditioning, suggesting that this subpopulation encodes persistent fear memory representing the original CS\textendash{}US association. This longitudinal report on LA neuronal activity during reversible fear learning suggests the existence of distinct populations encoding various facets of fear memory and provides insight into the neuronal mechanisms of fear memory modulation.},

  abstract = {Dendritic spines serve as the post-synaptic structural component of synapses. The structure and function of dendritic spines are dynamically regulated by a number of signaling pathways and allow for normal neural processing, whereas aberrant spine changes are thought to contribute to cognitive impairment in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, spine changes within different brain regions and their contribution to specific cognitive functions, especially later in adulthood, is not well understood. In this study, we used late-adult KALRN-deficient mice as a tool to investigate the vulnerability of different cognitive functions to long-term perturbations in spine plasticity in different forebrain regions. We found that in these mice, loss of one or both copies of KALRN lead to genotype and brain region-dependent reductions in spine density. Surprisingly, heterozygote and knockout mice showed differential impairments in cognitive phenotypes, including working memory, social recognition, and social approach. Correlation analysis between the site and magnitude of spine loss and behavioral alterations suggests that the interplay between brain regions is critical for complex cognitive processing and underscores the importance of spine plasticity in normal cognitive function. Long-term perturbation of spine plasticity results in distinct impairments of cognitive function. Using genetically modified mice deficient in a central regulator of spine plasticity, we investigated the brain region-specific contribution of spine numbers to various cognitive functions. We found distinct cognitive functions display differential sensitivity to spine loss in the cortex and hippocampus. Our data support spines as neuronal structures important for cognition and suggest interplay between brain regions is critical for complex cognitive processing.},

Hippocampal GABAA receptor expression undergoes marked reorganization during the postnatal period, however, and the effects of neonatal status epilepticus on subsequent GABAA receptor development are unknown. In the current study, we utilize single cell electrophysiology and antisense mRNA amplification to determine the effect of status-epilepticus induced by lithium-pilocarpine in postnatal day 10 rat pups on GABAA receptor subunit expression and function in hippocampal dentate granule neurons. We find that rats subjected to lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus at postnatal day 10 show long-term GABAA receptor changes including a two-fold increase in \ensuremath{\alpha}1 subunit expression (compared with lithium-injected controls) and enhanced type I benzodiazepine augmentation that are opposite of those seen after status epilepticus in adulthood and may serve to enhance dentate gyrus inhibition. Further, unlike adult rats, postnatal day 10 rats subjected to status epilepticus do not become epileptic. These findings suggest age-dependent differences in the effects of status epilepticus on hippocampal GABAA receptors that could contribute to the selective resistance of the immature brain to epileptogenesis.},

These new techniques allow us to focus on the input region of the neuron and highlight the excitable properties of the dendritic membrane. Interestingly, some of the recent experimental findings were anticipated by earlier theoretical research, for example, the observation that some spines possess excitable channels that might generate local all-or-none events. Computer models were used previously to explore the conditions for initiating an action potential at the dendritic tree, in particular, at the spine head, and for active propagation between excitable spines and excitable dendritic arbors. The consequences for synaptic amplification, for the extent of active spread in the tree and for non-linear discriminations between different patterns of synaptic inputs were also considered. Here we review the biophysical insights gained from the theory and demonstrate how these elucidate the recent experimental results.

Meditators were predicted to show greater gray matter concentration in regions that are typically activated during meditation. Results confirmed greater gray matter concentration for meditators in the right anterior insula, which is involved in interoceptive awareness. This group difference presumably reflects the training of bodily awareness during mindfulness meditation. Furthermore, meditators had greater gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus and right hippocampus. Both regions have previously been found to be involved in meditation. The mean value of gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus was predictable by the amount of meditation training, corroborating the assumption of a causal impact of meditation training on gray matter concentration in this region. Results suggest that meditation practice is associated with structural differences in regions that are typically activated during meditation and in regions that are relevant for the task of meditation.},

  abstract = {Metaplasticity, the plasticity of synaptic plasticity, is thought to have a pivotal role in activity-dependent modulation of synaptic connectivity, which underlies learning and memory. Metaplasticity is usually attributed to modifications in glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. However, experimental evidence and theoretical considerations suggest that learning reduces the predisposition for further synaptic strengthening, while behavioral studies show that learning capability is enhanced by prior learning. Here we show that enhanced neuronal excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons, but not enhanced synaptic transmission, occurs prior to rule learning of an olfactory discrimination task. This transient enhancement lasts for 1 day after rule learning, is apparent throughout the cell population and results from reduction in the medium and slow after-hyperpolarizations that control spike frequency adaptation. Such olfactory learning-induced increased excitability in hippocampal neurons enhances the rats' learning capability in another hippocampus-dependent task, the Morris water maze. Once olfactory discrimination rule learning is acquired, its maintenance is not dependent on the reduced post-burst AHP in hippocampal neurons. However, the enhanced spatial learning capability of olfactory-trained rats in the water maze is diminished once the post burst AHP in CA1 pyramidal cells resumes its initial value. We suggest that enhanced excitability of CA1 neurons may serve as a mechanism for generalized enhancement of hippocampus-dependent learning capability. In the presence of such enhanced neuronal excitability, the hippocampal network enters into a `learning mode' in which a variety of hippocampus-dependent skills are acquired rapidly and efficiently.},

Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DHEA administration in healthy young men on episodic memory and its neural correlates utilising an event-related potential (ERP) technique. Methods Twenty-four healthy young men were treated with a 7-day course of oral DHEA (150 mg b.d.) or placebo in a double blind, random, crossover and balanced order design. Subjective mood and memory were measured using visual analogue scales (VASs). Cortisol concentrations were measured in saliva samples. ERPs were recorded during retrieval in an episodic memory test. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to identify brain regions involved in the cognitive task. Results DHEA administration led to a reduction in evening cortisol concentrations and improved VAS mood and memory. Recollection accuracy in the episodic memory test was significantly improved following DHEA administration. LORETA revealed significant hippocampal activation associated with successful episodic memory retrieval following placebo. DHEA modified ERPs associated with retrieval and led to a trend towards an early differential activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Conclusions DHEA treatment improved memory recollection and mood and decreased trough cortisol levels. The effect of DHEA appears to be via neuronal recruitment of the steroid sensitive ACC that may be involved in pre-hippocampal memory processing. These findings are distinctive, being the first to show such beneficial effects of DHEA on memory in healthy young men.},

Although LTP can persist for long periods of time, the mechanisms underlying LTP maintenance, in the midst of ongoing protein turnover and synaptic activity, remain elusive. Sustained activation of the brain-specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoform protein kinase M-\ensuremath{\zeta} (PKM-\ensuremath{\zeta}) has been reported to be necessary for both LTP maintenance and long-term memory. Inhibiting PKM-\ensuremath{\zeta} activity using a synthetic zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) based on the PKC-\ensuremath{\zeta} pseudosubstrate sequence reverses established LTP in vitro and in vivo. More notably, infusion of ZIP eliminates memories for a growing list of experience-dependent behaviours, including active place avoidance, conditioned taste aversion, fear conditioning and spatial learning. However, most of the evidence supporting a role for PKM-\ensuremath{\zeta} in LTP and memory relies heavily on pharmacological inhibition of PKM-\ensuremath{\zeta} by ZIP. To further investigate the involvement of PKM-\ensuremath{\zeta} in the maintenance of LTP and memory, we generated transgenic mice lacking PKC-\ensuremath{\zeta} and PKM-\ensuremath{\zeta}. We find that both conventional and conditional PKC-\ensuremath{\zeta}/PKM-\ensuremath{\zeta} knockout mice show normal synaptic transmission and LTP at Schaffer collateral\textendash{}CA1 synapses, and have no deficits in several hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks. Notably, ZIP still reverses LTP in PKC-\ensuremath{\zeta}/PKM-\ensuremath{\zeta} knockout mice, indicating that the effects of ZIP are independent of PKM-\ensuremath{\zeta}.},

Follow-up interviews were conducted with 109 patients, of whom, 99 (91\%) reported a relapse. The initial relapse occurred within one week in 64 (59\%) cases. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that earlier relapse was significantly predicted by younger age, greater heroin use prior to treatment, history of injecting, and a failure to enter aftercare. Unexpectedly, those who were in a relationship with an opiate user had significantly delayed relapse. Those who completed the entire six-week inpatient treatment programme also had a significantly delayed relapse. In order to reduce relapse and the associated increased risk of fatal overdose, services providing residential opiate detoxification should prepare people for admission, strive to retain them in treatment for the full admission period and actively support their entry into planned aftercare in order to improve outcome.},

  abstract = {Memory consolidation is the process by which a newly formed and unstable memory transforms into a stable long-term memory. It is unknown whether the process of memory consolidation occurs exclusively through the stabilization of memory engrams. By using learning-dependent cell labeling, we identified an increase of synaptic strength and dendritic spine density specifically in consolidated memory engram cells. Although these properties are lacking in engram cells under protein synthesis inhibitor\textendash{}induced amnesia, direct optogenetic activation of these cells results in memory retrieval, and this correlates with retained engram cell\textendash{}specific connectivity. We propose that a specific pattern of connectivity of engram cells may be crucial for memory information storage and that strengthened synapses in these cells critically contribute to the memory retrieval process.
Experimental recovery from retrograde amnesia
When memory researchers induce amnesia, they normally assume that the manipulations prevent the memory engram from effective encoding at consolidation. In accordance with this, Ryan et al. found that after the injection of protein synthesis inhibitors, animals could not retrieve a memory. However, to their surprise, the memory could nevertheless be reactivated by light-induced activation of the neurons tagged during conditioning. Increased synaptic strength that is the result of cellular consolidation is thus not a critical requisite for storing a memory.

While neuronal loss does not appear to underlie these effects, dendritic spine loss has been shown to occur. In experiments reported here, seizures induced either by tetanus toxin or flurothyl during the second postnatal week were found to reduce the expression of NMDA receptor subunits in both the hippocampus and neocortex. Most experiments focused on alterations in the expression of the NR2A subunit and its associated scaffolding protein, PSD95, since their expression is developmentally regulated. Results suggest that the depression in expression can be delayed by at least 5 days but persists for at least 3-4 weeks. These effects were dependent on the number of seizures experienced, and were not observed when seizures were induced in adult mice. Taken together, the results suggest that recurrent seizures in infancy may interrupt synapse maturation and produce persistent decreases in molecular markers for glutamatergic synapses - particularly components of the NMDA receptor complex implicated in learning and memory.},

Whether this involves plasticity that is specifically required for long-term consolidation remains unclear. We found that learning-induced plasticity of local parvalbumin (PV) basket cells was specifically required for long-term, but not short/intermediate-term, memory consolidation in mice. PV plasticity, which involves changes in PV and GAD67 expression and connectivity onto PV neurons, was regulated by cAMP signaling in PV neurons. Following induction, PV plasticity depended on local D1/5 dopamine receptor signaling at 0-5 h to regulate its magnitude, and at 12-14 h for its continuance, ensuring memory consolidation. D1/5 dopamine receptor activation selectively induced DARPP-32 and ERK phosphorylation in PV neurons. At 12-14 h, PV plasticity was required for enhanced sharp-wave ripple densities and c-Fos expression in pyramidal neurons. Our results reveal general network mechanisms of long-term memory consolidation that requires plasticity of PV basket cells induced after acquisition and sustained subsequently through D1/5 receptor signaling.},

To evaluate the possibility that abnormal neural activity during early development may have long-term functional effects in hippocampal circuitry that plays a role in learning, memory and epilepsy, functional properties of hippocampal circuitry were assessed in adult rats that had experienced seizures induced by kainic acid on specific days during early postnatal development. Although previous studies have suggested that the immature hippocampus is relatively resistant to seizure-induced alterations compared with adults, independent behavioural and physiological experiments demonstrated that seizures evoked by kainic acid during early postnatal development induced a long-term loss of hippocampal plasticity manifesting as reduced capacity for long-term potentiation, reduced susceptibility to kindling, and impaired spatial learning, which was associated with enhanced paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus. The enhancement of inhibition and loss of plasticity were maximal when the seizures occurred on the first day of life, but were also observed when seizures were induced as late as postnatal day 14, which delimited a period of postnatal susceptibility in the developing rat hippocampus when disruption of normal neural activity by seizures produced consistent effects on a hippocampal-dependent behaviour and several forms of hippocampal plasticity implicated in learning, memory and the development of epilepsy in adulthood.},

While zebrafish has lagged behind other model systems in the widespread application of Gal4 transgenic approaches to modulate gene activity during development, recent technological advances are permitting rapid progress. Here we review Gal4-regulated genetic tools and discuss how they have been used in zebrafish as well as their potential drawbacks. We describe some exciting new directions, in large part afforded by the Tol2 transposition system, that are generating valuable new Gal4/UAS reagents for zebrafish research.},

Marked and severe kidney nephropathies were also generally 1.3\textendash{}2.3 greater. Males presented 4 times more large palpable tumors than controls which occurred up to 600 days earlier. Biochemistry data confirmed very significant kidney chronic deficiencies; for all treatments and both sexes, 76\% of the altered parameters were kidney related.

  abstract = {Summary: The ketogenic diet (KD) is a broadly effective treatment for medically refractory epilepsy. Despite nearly a century of use, the mechanisms underlying its clinical efficacy remain unknown. In this review, we present one intersecting view of how the KD may exert its anticonvulsant activity against the backdrop of several seemingly disparate mechanistic theories. We summarize key insights gleaned from experimental and clinical studies of the KD, and focus particular attention on the role that ketone bodies, fatty acids, and limited glucose may play in seizure control. Chronic ketosis is anticipated to modify the tricarboxcylic acid cycle to increase GABA synthesis in brain, limit reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and boost energy production in brain tissue. Among several direct neuro-inhibitory actions, polyunsaturated fatty acids increased after KD induce the expression of neuronal uncoupling proteins (UCPs), a collective up-regulation of numerous energy metabolism genes, and mitochondrial biogenesis. These effects further limit ROS generation and increase energy production. As a result of limited glucose and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, reduced glycolytic flux is hypothesized to activate metabolic KATP channels and hyperpolarize neurons and/or glia. Although it is unlikely that a single mechanism, however well substantiated, will explain all of the diet's clinical benefits, these diverse, coordinated changes seem poised to stabilize synaptic function and increase the resistance to seizures throughout the brain.},

  abstract = {The present study is part of an ongoing project aimed at understanding the electrophysiologic properties of single amygdaloid neurons and their correlations with the morphology of the somata as well as axonal and dendritic trees. The axonal morphology of 14 three-dimensional, reconstructed spiny neurons (4 in the lateral and 10 in the basal nucleus) that were filled in vivo with intracellular injections of biocytin is described. Three-dimensional reconstruction was performed using Neurolucida software (MicroBrightField). Sholl analysis was used to assess the axonal length as well as the number of axonal varicosities and endings within concentric spherical shells placed at 50- micro m intervals from the soma. These data indicate that the same neuron can innervate several amygdaloid nuclear divisions or nuclei and extra-amygdaloid regions. This finding suggests that the same neuron can modulate various brain areas in parallel. Both the presumed intra-amygdaloid (all axonal branches within the amygdala) and extra-amygdaloid (axons also outside the amygdala) projection neurons have dense perisomatic axonal arborizations, and consequently, the intra-amygdaloid and extra-amygdaloid projection neurons are difficult to differentiate based on the analysis of perisomatic axonal morphology. Furthermore, the same extra-amygdaloid neuron can drive many neurons both locally as well as at extra-amygdaloid projection areas within a relatively short time. Finally, the axonal morphology of spiny neurons located in the lateral or basal nuclei was similar. These data provide baseline quantitative information about the axonal dimensions of amygdaloid neurons and can form the anatomic basis for modeling amygdaloid neuronal circuits when more quantitative data regarding neuronal numbers, size, and dendritic morphology become available.},

The effect occurred even if reactivation was delayed for 45 days after training, a time when contextual memory is independent of the hippocampus. Indeed, reactivation of a hippocampus-independent memory caused the trace to again become hippocampus dependent, but only for 2 days rather than for weeks.

  volume = {70},
  issn = {0301-0082},
  abstract = {Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is a membrane-spanning protein with a large extracellular domain and a much smaller intracellular domain. It is the source of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide found in neuritic plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Because Abeta shows neurotoxic properties, and because familial forms of AD promote Abeta accumulation, a massive international research effort has been aimed at understanding the mechanisms of Abeta generation, catabolism and toxicity. APP, however, is an extremely complex molecule that may be a functionally important molecule in its full-length configuration, as well as being the source of numerous fragments with varying effects on neural function. For example, one fragment derived from the non-amyloidogenic processing pathway, secreted APPalpha (sAPPalpha), is neuroprotective, neurotrophic and regulates cell excitability and synaptic plasticity, while Abeta appears to exert opposing effects. Less is known about the neural functions of other fragments, but there is a growing interest in understanding the basic biology of APP as it has become recognized that alterations in the functional activity of the APP fragments during disease states will have complex effects on cell function. Indeed, it has been proposed that reductions in the level or activity of certain APP fragments, in addition to accumulation of Abeta, may play a critical role in the cognitive dysfunction associated with AD, particularly early in the course of the disease. To test and modify this hypothesis, it is important to understand the roles that full-length APP and its fragments normally play in neuronal structure and function. Here we review evidence addressing these fundamental questions, paying particular attention to the contributions that APP fragments play in synaptic transmission and neural plasticity, as these may be key to understanding their effects on learning and memory. It is clear from this literature that APP fragments, including Abeta, can exert a powerful regulation of key neural functions including cell excitability, synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation, both acutely and over the long-term. Furthermore, there is a small but growing literature confirming that these fragments correspondingly regulate behavioral learning and memory. These data indicate that a full account of cognitive dysfunction in AD will need to incorporate the actions of the full complement of APP fragments. To this end, there is an urgent need for a dedicated research effort aimed at understanding the behavioral consequences of altered levels and activity of the different APP fragments as a result of experience and disease.},

  abstract = {Rats, humans, and monkeys demonstrate robust crossmodal object recognition (CMOR), identifying objects across sensory modalities. We have shown that rats' performance of a spontaneous tactile-to-visual CMOR task requires functional integration of perirhinal (PRh) and posterior parietal (PPC) cortices, which seemingly provide visual and tactile object feature processing, respectively. However, research with primates has suggested that PRh is sufficient for multisensory object representation. We tested this hypothesis in rats using a modification of the CMOR task in which multimodal preexposure to the to-be-remembered objects significantly facilitates performance. In the original CMOR task, with no preexposure, reversible lesions of PRh or PPC produced patterns of impairment consistent with modality-specific contributions. Conversely, in the CMOR task with preexposure, PPC lesions had no effect, whereas PRh involvement was robust, proving necessary for phases of the task that did not require PRh activity when rats did not have preexposure; this pattern was supported by results from c-fos imaging. We suggest that multimodal preexposure alters the circuitry responsible for object recognition, in this case obviating the need for PPC contributions and expanding PRh involvement, consistent with the polymodal nature of PRh connections and results from primates indicating a key role for PRh in multisensory object representation. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of multisensory information processing, suggesting that the nature of an individual's past experience with an object strongly determines the brain circuitry involved in representing that object's multisensory features in memory.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The ability to integrate information from multiple sensory modalities is crucial to the survival of organisms living in complex environments. Appropriate responses to behaviorally relevant objects are informed by integration of multisensory object features. We used crossmodal object recognition tasks in rats to study the neurobiological basis of multisensory object representation. When rats had no prior exposure to the to-be-remembered objects, the spontaneous ability to recognize objects across sensory modalities relied on functional interaction between multiple cortical regions. However, prior multisensory exploration of the task-relevant objects remapped cortical contributions, negating the involvement of one region and significantly expanding the role of another. This finding emphasizes the dynamic nature of cortical representation of objects in relation to past experience.},

  abstract = {The role of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus is controversial. In the present study, we have used mice in which the mGlu1, mGlu5 or mGlu7 receptor has been deleted, by homologous recombination, to study the role of these receptor subtypes in LTP at CA1 synapses. We investigated the effects of the knockouts on both LTP and the molecular switch, a form of metaplasticity that renders LTP insensitive to the actions of the mGlu receptor antagonist MCPG ((S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine). We find that LTP is readily induced in the three knockouts and in an mGlu1 and mGlu5 double knockout. In addition, the molecular switch operates normally in either the mGlu1 or mGlu7 knockout. In contrast, the molecular switch is completely non-functional in the mGlu5 knockout, such that MCPG invariably blocks the induction of additional LTP in an input where LTP has already been induced. The effect of the mGlu5 receptor knockout was replicated in wildtype mouse slices perfused with the specific mGlu5 receptor antagonist MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine). In addition, the mGlu5 selective agonist CHPG ((RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine) sets the molecular switch. These data demonstrate that the operation of the molecular switch requires activation of mGlu5 receptors.},

Conscious rabbits were exposed for 1 hr to 40 degrees C (heat stress) while cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma osmolality and the CSF concentrations of some cations, proteins as well as those of taurine and GABA were determined. Heat stress-induced hyperthermia was accompanied by a significant rise in CSF and plasma osmolality, CSF calcium, taurine and GABA levels. It is suggested that during heat stress taurine and GABA are released in the extracellular space of brain tissues in higher amounts, as compared to control conditions, to counteract the resulting hyperthermia, thus acting as cryogenic agents.},

  abstract = {Cellular studies have focused on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) to understand requirements for persistent changes in synaptic connections. Whereas LTP is induced through high-frequency intermittent stimulation, low-frequency stimulation evokes LTD. Because of the ubiquitous efficacy of these protocols, they are considered fundamental mechanisms underlying learning. Here we adapted LTP/LTD-like protocols to visual stimulation to alter human visually guided behavior. In a change-detection task, participants reported luminance changes against distracting orientation changes. Subsequently, they were exposed to passive visual high- or low-frequency stimulation of either the relevant luminance or irrelevant orientation feature. LTP-like high-frequency protocols using luminance improved ability to detect luminance changes, whereas low-frequency LTD-like stimulation impaired performance. In contrast, LTP-like exposure of the irrelevant orientation feature impaired performance, whereas LTD-like orientation stimulation improved it. LTP-like effects were present for 10 days, whereas LTD-like effects lasted for a shorter period of time. Our data demonstrate that instead of electrically stimulating synapses, selective behavioral changes are evoked in humans by using equivalently timed visual stimulation, suggesting that both LTD- and LTP-like protocols control human behavior but that the direction of changes is determined by the feature incorporated into the stimulation protocol.},

  abstract = {In cortical networks, different types of inhibitory interneurons control the activity of glutamatergic principal cells and GABAergic interneurons. Principal neurons represent the major postsynaptic target of most interneurons; however, a population of interneurons that is dedicated to the selective innervation of GABAergic cells exists in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. The physiological properties of these cells and their functional relevance for network computations remain unknown. Here, we used a combination of dual simultaneous patch-clamp recordings and targeted optogenetic stimulation in acute mouse hippocampal slices to examine how one class of interneuron-specific (IS) cells controls the activity of its GABAergic targets. We found that type 3 IS (IS3) cells that coexpress the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and calretinin contact several distinct types of interneurons within the hippocampal CA1 stratum oriens/alveus (O/A), with preferential innervation of oriens-lacunosum moleculare cells (OLMs) through dendritic synapses. In contrast, VIP-positive basket cells provided perisomatic inhibition to CA1 pyramidal neurons with the asynchronous GABA release and were not connected with O/A interneurons. Furthermore, unitary IPSCs recorded at IS3\textendash{}OLM synapses had a small amplitude and low release probability but summated efficiently during high-frequency firing of IS3 interneurons. Moreover, the synchronous generation of a single spike in several IS cells that converged onto a single OLM controlled the firing rate and timing of OLM interneurons. Therefore, dendritic inhibition originating from IS cells is needed for the flexible activity-dependent recruitment of OLM interneurons for feedback inhibition.},

  abstract = {VPS10 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a type I transmembrane receptor protein required for the sorting of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y (CPY). To characterize the essential structural features and intercompartmental transport itinerary of the CPY receptor, we have constructed mutant forms of Vps10p that alter the carboxyterminal cytoplasmic tail of the protein. In addition, we have analyzed the effect these mutations as well as mutations in several VPS genes have on the function, stability, and localization of Vps10p. Although wild-type Vps10p is very stable over a 3-h chase period, overproduction of Vps10p results in PEP4-dependent degradation of the receptor. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that overexpressed receptor is delivered to the vacuole. A mutant form of Vps10p, in which 157 residues of the 164-residue cytoplasmic tail domain have been deleted, missorts CPY and is degraded rapidly. Additional mutations in the carboxy-terminus of Vps10p, including a deletion of a putative retention/recycling signal (FYVF), also result in CPY missorting and PEP4-dependent receptor instability. Because the cytoplasmic tail domain may interact with other factors, possibly VPS gene products, Vps10p stability was examined in a number of vps mutants. As was observed with the late Golgi protein Kex2p, Vps10p is unstable in a vps1 mutant. However, instability of Vps10p is even more severe in the class E vps mutants. Double mutant analyses demonstrate that this rapid degradation is dependent upon vacuolar proteases and a functional vacuolar ATPase. Fractionation studies of Vps10p in class E vps mutant strains indicate that the turnover of Vps10p occurs in a compartment other than the vacuole. These data are consistent with a model in which the cytoplasmic tail of Vps10p directs cycling of the receptor between a late Golgi sorting compartment and a prevacuolar endosome-like compartment, an exaggerated form of which is present in the vps class E mutants.},

  abstract = {Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by cholinergic hypofunction, neuronal marker loss, and decreased nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) density from the cortex and hippocampus. alpha7 nAChRs expressed on cholinergic projection neurons and target regions have been implicated in neuroprotection against beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity and maintenance of the septohippocampal phenotype. We tested the role that alpha7 nAChRs perform in the etiology of early AD by genetically deleting the alpha7 nAChR subunit from the Tg2576 mouse model for AD and assessing animals for cognitive function and septohippocampal integrity. Thus, Tg2576 mice transgenic for mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) were crossed with alpha7 nAChR knock-out mice (A7KO) to render an animal with elevated Abeta in the absence of alpha7 nAChRs (A7KO-APP). We found that learning and memory deficits seen in 5-month-old APP mice are more severe in the A7KO-APP animals. Analyses of animals in early-stage preplaque cognitive decline revealed signs of neurodegeneration in A7KO-APP hippocampus as well as loss of cholinergic functionality in the basal forebrain and hippocampus. These changes occurred concomitant with the appearance of a dodecameric oligomer of Abeta that was absent from all other genotypic groups, generating the hypothesis that increased soluble oligomeric Abeta may underlie additional impairment of A7KO-APP cognitive function. Thus, alpha7 nAChRs in a mouse model for early-stage AD appear to serve a neuroprotective role through maintenance of the septohippocampal cholinergic phenotype and preservation of hippocampal integrity possibly through influences on Abeta accumulation and oligomerization.},

As a result, the circuits in amygdala could be drawn more elaborately, and it led us to understand how fear or extinction memories are formed in the detailed circuit level, and various neuromodulators affect these circuit activities, inducing subtle behavioral changes.},

  abstract = {Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), one of the most abundant neurosteroids synthesized de novo in the nervous system, has well characterized effects on memory and cognitive performances. However, little is known about the underlying synaptic mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic administration of DHEAS (20 mg/kg for 7 days) on the plasticity of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses by applying an optical recording technique on the hippocampal slices stained with voltage-sensitive dyes. We report here that chronically administered DHEAS significantly facilitated the induction of frequency-dependent LTP, termed DHEAS-facilitated LTP. While tetanus of at least 50 pulses (at 100 Hz) were required to induce LTP in control rats, only 20 pulses were needed in DHEAS-treated animals. In contrast DHEA, the non-sulfated form of DHEAS, had no facilitating effect on the induction of LTP. We found that chronically administered DHEAS did not alter the presynaptic glutamate release in response to both single pulse and tetanic stimulation, suggesting that certain alterations happened in postsynaptic neurons. Co-administration of the sigma 1 (sigma1) receptor antagonists, haloperidol or NE100, with DHEAS completely inhibited the DHEAS-facilitated LTP. However, acute administration of sigma1 receptor antagonists to the slices did not affect the induction of DHEAS-facilitated LTP, suggesting that sigma1 receptor is a key target of chronic actions of DHEAS but is not involved in the induction of DHEAS-facilitated LTP. Our findings provide evidence that chronically administered DHEAS plays a priming role in inducing a facilitated synaptic plasticity probably via a chronic activation of sigma1 receptor in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.},

  abstract = {This project aimed to investigate the metabolic basis for resilience to neurodegeneration (cognitive reserve) in highly educated patients with prodromal Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHODS: Sixty-four patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who later converted to AD dementia during follow-up, and 90 controls, underwent brain (18)F-FDG PET. Both groups were divided into a poorly educated subgroup (42 controls and 36 prodromal AD patients) and a highly educated subgroup (48 controls and 28 prodromal AD patients). Brain metabolism was first compared between education-matched groups of patients and controls. Then, metabolism was compared between highly and poorly educated prodromal AD patients in both directions to identify regions of high education-related metabolic depression and compensation. The clusters of significant depression and compensation were further used as volumetric regions of interest (ROIs) in a brain interregional correlation analysis in each prodromal AD subgroup to explore metabolic connectivity. All analyses were performed by means of SPM8 (P \ensuremath{<} 0.001 uncorrected at peak level, P \ensuremath{<} 0.05 false discovery rate-corrected at cluster level; age, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and center as nuisance).
RESULTS: Highly educated prodromal AD patients showed more severe hypometabolism than poorly educated prodromal AD patients in the left inferior and middle temporal gyri and the left middle occipital gyrus (ROI depression). Conversely, they showed relative hypermetabolism in the right inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri (ROI compensation). The sites of compensation, mainly corresponding to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFC), showed wide metabolic correlations with several cortical areas in both hemispheres (frontotemporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus) in highly educated prodromal AD patients but not in poorly educated prodromal AD patients. To provide evidence on whether these metabolic correlations represent preservation of the physiologic networks of highly educated control subjects (neural reserve) or rather the recruitment of alternative networks (neural compensation), or a combination of the two, we performed metabolic connectivity analysis of the DLFC in highly educated controls as well. The correlation sites of right DLFC partly overlapped those of highly educated prodromal AD patients but were less extended.
CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that highly educated prodromal AD patients can cope better with the disease thanks to neural reserve but also to the recruitment of compensatory neural networks in which the right DLFC plays a key role.},

  abstract = {AIMS: \ensuremath{\beta}-amyloid (A\ensuremath{\beta}) plaques are a key feature of Alzheimer's disease pathology but correlate poorly with dementia. They are associated with astrocytes which may modulate the effect of A\ensuremath{\beta}-deposition on the neuropil. This study characterised the astrocyte response to A\ensuremath{\beta} plaque subtypes, and investigated their association with cognitive impairment.
METHODS: A\ensuremath{\beta} plaque subtypes were identified in the cingulate gyrus using dual labelling immunohistochemistry to A\ensuremath{\beta} and GFAP+ astrocytes, and quantitated in two cortical areas: the area of densest plaque burden and the deep cortex near the white matter border (layer VI). Three subtypes were defined for both diffuse and compact plaques (also known as classical or core-plaques): A\ensuremath{\beta} plaque with (1) no associated astrocytes, (2) focal astrogliosis or (3) circumferential astrogliosis.
RESULTS: In the area of densest burden, diffuse plaques with no astrogliosis (\ensuremath{\beta} = -0.05, p = 0.001) and with focal astrogliosis (\ensuremath{\beta} = -0.27, p = 0.009) significantly associated with lower MMSE scores when controlling for sex and age at death. In the deep cortex (layer VI), both diffuse and compact plaques without astrogliosis associated with lower MMSE scores (\ensuremath{\beta} = -0.15, p = 0.017 and \ensuremath{\beta} = -0.81, p = 0.03, respectively). Diffuse plaques with no astrogliosis in layer VI related to dementia status (OR = 1.05, p = 0.025). In the area of densest burden, diffuse plaques with no astrogliosis or with focal astrogliosis associated with increasing Braak stage (\ensuremath{\beta} = 0.01, p\ensuremath{<}0.001 and \ensuremath{\beta} = 0.07, p\ensuremath{<}0.001, respectively), and ApoE\ensuremath{\epsilon}4 genotype (OR = 1.02, p = 0.001 and OR = 1.10, p = 0.016, respectively). In layer VI all plaque subtypes associated with Braak stage, and compact amyloid plaques with little and no associated astrogliosis associated with ApoE\ensuremath{\epsilon}4 genotype (OR = 1.50, p = 0.014 and OR = 0.10, p = 0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Reactive astrocytes in close proximity to either diffuse or compact plaques may have a neuroprotective role in the ageing brain, and possession of at least one copy of the ApoE\ensuremath{\epsilon}4 allele impacts the astroglial response to A\ensuremath{\beta} plaques.},

  volume = {412},
  issn = {0021-9967},
  abstract = {Projections to the amygdala from the auditory thalamus have been implicated in the associative conditioning of fear responses to acoustic stimuli. Thalamo-amygdala auditory projections enter the amygdala via the lateral nucleus (LA). It is well documented that these projections originate in the medial division (MGm) of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN), the posterior intralaminar nucleus (PIN), and the suprageniculate nucleus (Sg). It is not known, however, whether these thalamic projections terminate in a topographic fashion within the LA. We therefore used several retrograde tract tracing techniques to determine whether the terminations of thalamo-amygdala fibers have a topographic organization within the LA. These tracers were injected into various locations within the LA, and the distribution of the retrogradely labeled cells throughout the thalamus was analyzed. In general, rostral to caudal distinctions in the thalamus are maintained in the LA, such that projections from throughout the MGN terminate in the anterior part of the LA, whereas the caudal part of the MGN projects to the caudal part of the LA. Furthermore, the density of cells that give rise to thalamo-amygdala projections varies within each thalamic nucleus along the rostro-caudal axis. The patterns of thalamo-amygdala connectivity observed support previous parcellation schemes that segregate the LA into dorsal, medial, and lateral areas, and suggest that the LA should be further divided into anterior and posterior parts. In addition to the well-known projections to the LA originating from PIN, MGN, and Sg, we also found substantial projections from the dorsal portion of the MGN (MGd) and the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus (LP). These findings suggest that some of the functional segregation in the thalamus may be preserved in the LA, and that the role of the MGd and LP in thalamo-amygdala transmission should be reconsidered.},

  abstract = {Ongoing spontaneous postsynaptic potentials (SPSPs) were intracellularly recorded at 34-36 degrees C from hippocampal CA3 neurons in slices obtained from postnatal days (P) 0-6 and 7-31. SPSPs occurred randomly, and their frequency distribution was fitted by a single exponential function. They were little affected by kynurenic acid, but were reversibly blocked by bicuculline, implying that they were mediated by GABAA receptors. The mean amplitude was 4.53 +/- 0.89 mV in control conditions and 4.07 +/- 0.79 mV in kynurenic acid. In kynurenic acid (with CsCl-filled microelectrodes), SPSPs reversed polarity at 2.4 +/- 2 mV. When tetrodotoxin (1 microM) was added to kynurenic acid solution, GABAA-mediated miniature postsynaptic potentials (MPSPs) were recorded. Under these conditions large events disappeared. The mean amplitude of MPSPs was 2.51 +/- 0.43 mV. The mean frequency decreased from 2.96 +/- 1.04 Hz in kynurenic acid to 0.4 +/- 0.15 Hz in kynurenic acid plus tetrodotoxin. In contrast with P0-P6, at P7-P31 SPSPs were significantly affected by kynurenic acid. The mean amplitude of SPSPs shifted from 4.71 +/- 0.82 mV in control conditions to 3.79 +/- 0.76 mV in kynurenic acid. At this developmental stage, the reversal potential of GABAA-mediated SPSPs shifted towards more negative values (-23.7 +/- 1.3 mV). Addition of tetrodotoxin to kynurenic acid solution abolished larger events and revealed GABAergic MPSPs. The mean amplitude of MPSPs was 2.72 +/- 0.5 mV, a value very close to that observed at P0-P6. Synaptic currents were recorded at 22-24 degrees C from voltage-clamped CA3 pyramidal neurons (at P6) using the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Pavlovian fear conditioning is highly conserved across species, providing a powerful model of aversive learning. In rodents, fear memory is stored and reactivated under the influence of the amygdala. There is no evidence for an equivalent mechanism in primates, and an opposite mechanism is proposed whereby primate amygdala contributes only to an initial phase of aversive learning, subsequently ceding fear memory to extra-amygdalar regions. Here, we reexamine this question by exploiting human high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with multivariate methods. By assuming a sparse neural coding, we show it is possible, at an individual subject level, to discriminate responses to conditioned (CS+ and CS-) stimuli in both basolateral and centro-cortical amygdala nuclei. The strength of this discrimination increased over time and was tightly coupled to the behavioral expression of fear, consistent with an expression of a stable fear memory trace. These data highlight that the human basolateral and centro-cortical amygdala support initial learning as well more enduring fear memory storage. A sparse neuronal representation for fear, here revealed by multivariate pattern classification, resolves why an enduring memory trace has proven elusive in previous human studies.},

We find that sub-threshold fear conditioning leads to dopamine receptor D4-dependent long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic excitatory synapses by increasing inhibitory inputs onto neurons of the dorsal intercalated cell mass (ITC) in the amygdala. Pharmacological, genetic, and optogenetic manipulations of the amygdala regions centered on the dorsal ITC reveal that this LTD limits less salient experiences from forming persistent memories. In further support of the idea that LTD has preventive and discriminative roles, we find that LTD at the dorsal ITC is impaired in mice exhibiting PTSD-like behaviors. These findings reveal a novel role of inhibitory circuits in the amygdala, which serves to dampen and restrict the level of fear expression. This mechanism is interfered with by stimuli that give rise to PTSD and may also be recruited for fear-related psychiatric diseases.},

Memory is thought to be stored in the brain as an~ensemble of cells activated during learning. Although optical stimulation of a cell ensemble triggers the retrieval of the corresponding memory, it is unclear how the association of information occurs at the cell ensemble level. Using optogenetic stimulation without any sensory input in mice, we found that an artificial association between stored, non-related contextual, and fear information was generated through the synchronous activation of distinct cell ensembles corresponding to the stored information. This artificial association shared characteristics with physiologically associated memories, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity and protein synthesis dependence. These findings suggest that the association of information is achieved through the synchronous activity of distinct cell ensembles. This mechanism may underlie memory updating by incorporating novel information into pre-existing networks to form qualitatively new memories.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Epidemiological and preclinical studies suggest that mental activity levels may alter dementia risk. Clinical trials are now beginning to address the key issues of persistence of effect over extended follow-up and transfer of effect to nontrained domains. The aim of this report was to therefore systematically review results from clinical trials, which have examined the effect of cognitive exercise on longitudinal cognitive performance in healthy elderly individuals., Methods: MEDLINE, PubMed, and key references were used to generate an initial list of relevant studies (N = 54). These were reviewed to identify randomized controlled trials, which tested the effect of a discrete cognitive exercise training regime on longitudinal (\ensuremath{>}3 months) posttraining neuropsychological performance in healthy older adults. Seven RCTs met entry criteria. Prechange and postchange scores were integrated using a random effects weighted mean difference (WMD) meta-analytic approach (Review Manager Version 4.2)., Results: A strong effect size was observed for cognitive exercise interventions compared with wait-and-see control conditions (WMD = 1.07, CI: 0.32-1.83, z = 2.78, N = 7, p = 0.006, N = 3,194). RCTs with follow-up greater than 2 years did not appear to produce lower effect size estimates than those with less extended follow-up. Quality of reporting of trials was in general low., Conclusion: Cognitive exercise training in healthy older individuals produces strong and persistent protective effects on longitudinal neuropsychological performance. Transfer of these effects to dementia-relevant domains such as general cognition and daily functioning has also been reported in some studies. Importantly, cognitive exercise has yet to be shown to prevent incident dementia in an appropriately designed trial and this is now an international priority., Copyright (C) 2009 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry},

I both compare the mean fitness of haploid and diploid populations that are asexual and investigate the invasion of ``diploidy'' alleles in sexual populations. When deleterious mutations are partially recessive and somatic mutation is sufficiently common, somatic mutation provides a clear advantage to diploidy in both asexual and sexual species.},

  abstract = {Susceptibility to penicillin and other \ensuremath{\beta}-lactam-containing compounds is a common trait of Bacillus anthracis. \ensuremath{\beta}-lactam agents, particularly penicillin, have been used worldwide to treat anthrax in humans. Nonetheless, surveys of clinical and soil-derived strains reveal penicillin G resistance in 2 to 16\% of isolates tested. Bacterial resistance to \ensuremath{\beta}-lactam agents is often mediated by production of one or more types of \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamases that hydrolyze the \ensuremath{\beta}-lactam ring, inactivating the antimicrobial agent. Here, we report the presence of two \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamase (bla) genes in the penicillin-susceptible Sterne strain of B. anthracis. We identified bla1 by functional cloning with Escherichia coli. bla1 is a 927-nucleotide (nt) gene predicted to encode a protein with 93.8\% identity to the type I \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamase gene of Bacillus cereus. A second gene, bla2, was identified by searching the unfinished B. anthracis chromosome sequence database of The Institute for Genome Research for open reading frames (ORFs) predicted to encode \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamases. We found a partial ORF predicted to encode a protein with significant similarity to the carboxy-terminal end of the type II \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamase of B. cereus. DNA adjacent to the 5\ensuremath{'} end of the partial ORF was cloned using inverse PCR. bla2 is a 768-nt gene predicted to encode a protein with 92\% identity to the B. cereus type II enzyme. The bla1 and bla2 genes confer ampicillin resistance to E. coli and Bacillus subtilis when cloned individually in these species. The MICs of various antimicrobial agents for the E. coli clones indicate that the two \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamase genes confer different susceptibility profiles to E. coli; bla1 is a penicillinase, while bla2 appears to be a cephalosporinase. The \ensuremath{\beta}-galactosidase activities of B. cereus group species harboring bla promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusions indicate that bla1 is poorly transcribed in B. anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis. The bla2 gene is strongly expressed in B. cereus and B. thuringiensis and weakly expressed in B. anthracis. Taken together, these data indicate that the bla1 and bla2 genes of the B. anthracis Sterne strain encode functional \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamases of different types, but gene expression is usually not sufficient to confer resistance to \ensuremath{\beta}-lactam agents.},

The Arc/Arg3.1 gene product is rapidly upregulated by strong synaptic activity and critically contributes to weakening synapses by promoting AMPA-R endocytosis. However, how activity-induced Arc is redistributed and determines the synapses to be weakened remains unclear. Here, we show targeting of Arc to inactive synapses via a high-affinity interaction with CaMKII\ensuremath{\beta} that is not bound to calmodulin. Synaptic Arc accumulates in inactive synapses that previously experienced strong activation and correlates with removal of surface GluA1 from individual synapses. A lack of CaMKII\ensuremath{\beta} either in~vitro or in~vivo resulted in loss of Arc upregulation in the silenced synapses. The discovery of Arc's role in ``inverse'' synaptic tagging that is specific for weaker synapses and prevents undesired enhancement of weak synapses in potentiated neurons reconciles essential roles of Arc both for the late phase of long-term plasticity and for reduction of surface AMPA-Rs in stimulated neurons.},

Here we used two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to monitor the activity of two Rho GTPases-RhoA and Cdc42-in single dendritic spines undergoing structural plasticity associated with long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured slices of rat hippocampus. When long-term volume increase was induced in a single spine using two-photon glutamate uncaging, RhoA and Cdc42 were rapidly activated in the stimulated spine. These activities decayed over about five minutes, and were then followed by a phase of persistent activation lasting more than half an hour. Although active RhoA and Cdc42 were similarly mobile, their activity patterns were different. RhoA activation diffused out of the stimulated spine and spread over about 5 \ensuremath{\mathrm{\mu}}m along the dendrite. In contrast, Cdc42 activation was restricted to the stimulated spine, and exhibited a steep gradient at the spine necks. Inhibition of the Rho-Rock pathway preferentially inhibited the initial spine growth, whereas the inhibition of the Cdc42-Pak pathway blocked the maintenance of sustained structural plasticity. RhoA and Cdc42 activation depended on Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII). Thus, RhoA and Cdc42 relay transient CaMKII activation to synapse-specific, long-term signalling required for spine structural plasticity.},

  abstract = {Since the first reports of neurofeedback treatment in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in 1976, many studies have investigated the effects of neurofeedback on different symptoms of ADHD such as inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. This technique is also used by many practitioners, but the question as to the evidence-based level of this treatment is still unclear. In this study selected research on neurofeedback treatment for ADHD was collected and a meta-analysis was performed. Both prospective controlled studies and studies employing a pre- and post-design found large effect sizes (ES) for neurofeedback on impulsivity and inattention and a medium ES for hyperactivity. Randomized studies demonstrated a lower ES for hyperactivity suggesting that hyperactivity is probably most sensitive to nonspecific treatment factors. Due to the inclusion of some very recent and sound methodological studies in this meta-analysis, potential confounding factors such as small studies, lack of randomization in previous studies and a lack of adequate control groups have been addressed, and the clinical effects of neurofeedback in the treatment of ADHD can be regarded as clinically meaningful. Three randomized studies have employed a semi-active control group which can be regarded as a credible sham control providing an equal level of cognitive training and client-therapist interaction. Therefore, in line with the AAPB and ISNR guidelines for rating clinical efficacy, we conclude that neurofeedback treatment for ADHD can be considered "Efficacious and Specific" (Level 5) with a large ES for inattention and impulsivity and a medium ES for hyperactivity.},

  abstract = {In previous studies, we observed a transient increase in dendritic spine frequency in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus at 6h following passive avoidance training [O'Malley A., O'Connell C. and Regan C. M. (1998) Neuroscience 87, 607-613]. To determine if a similar change is associated with spatial forms of learning, we have estimated time-dependent modulations of spine number in the dentate gyrus of the adult rat following water maze training. All animals exhibited significant reductions in the latency to locate the platform over the five training sessions of the single trial (median and interquartile ranges of 60, 8 versus 8, 3 s for trials 1 and 5, respectively) and this improved performance was retained just prior to killing at the 6h post-training time. The unbiased dissector stereological procedure was used to estimate spine number in serial pairs of ultrathin coronal sections obtained at a point 3.3 mm caudal of Bregma. This analysis revealed a significant learning-associated increase in spine number at the 6h post-training time (1.32+/-0.18 spines/microm(3)) as it was not observed in paired controls exposed to the water maze for a similar swim-time (0.66+/-0.11 spines/microm(3)). The increase was transient as spine number returned to control levels at the 72 h post-training time. These spine frequency changes are proposed to reflect increased synapse turnover rate and concomitant change in connectivity pattern in the processing of information for long-term storage.},

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), one of the most widely used mindfulness training programs, has been reported to produce positive effects on psychological well-being and to ameliorate symptoms of a number of disorders. Here, we report a controlled longitudinal study to investigate pre-post changes in brain gray matter concentration attributable to participation in an MBSR program. Anatomical MRI images from sixteen healthy, meditation-na{\"\i}ve participants were obtained before and after they underwent the eight-week program. Changes in gray matter concentration were investigated using voxel-based morphometry, and compared to a wait-list control group of 17 individuals. Analyses in a priori regions of interest confirmed increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus. Whole brain analyses identified increases in the posterior cingulate cortex, the temporo-parietal junction, and the cerebellum in the MBSR group compared to the controls. The results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.},

  abstract = {The hippocampal cognitive map is thought to be driven by distal visual cues and self-motion cues. However, other sensory cues also influence place cells. Hence, we measured rat hippocampal activity in virtual reality (VR), where only distal visual and nonvestibular self-motion cues provided spatial information, and in the real world (RW). In VR, place cells showed robust spatial selectivity; however, only 20\% were track active, compared with 45\% in the RW. This indicates that distal visual and nonvestibular self-motion cues are sufficient to provide selectivity, but vestibular and other sensory cues present in RW are necessary to fully activate the place-cell population. In addition, bidirectional cells preferentially encoded distance along the track in VR, while encoding absolute position in RW. Taken together, these results suggest the differential contributions of these sensory cues in shaping the hippocampal population code. Theta frequency was reduced, and its speed dependence was abolished in VR, but phase precession was unaffected, constraining mechanisms governing both hippocampal theta oscillations and temporal coding. These results reveal cooperative and competitive interactions between sensory cues for control over hippocampal spatiotemporal selectivity and theta rhythm.
A Sense of Place
Hippocampal place cells are believed to be mainly governed by visual and self-motion cues. However, the contribution of sensory cues such as smells, sounds, and textures, etc., is difficult to eliminate. In virtual reality, these cues will not provide any information about the animals' position. Ravassard et al. (p. 1342, published online 2 May) developed a virtual-reality system as immersive and close to the real world as possible and compared place cells in rats running in this apparatus and in the real world. Twice as many neurons were active in a real-world situation compared to virtual reality. While place cells in the real world encoded position, place cells in a virtual world encoded distance.},

Two days after completion of all training, we observed a memory-specific increase in the number of mushroom spines-all of which make synaptic contacts-but not in the numbers of filopodia or stubby or thin spines, as quantified with double-blind protocols in both scanning confocal and electron microscopic images. This memory-specific increase of mushroom spine number was enhanced by the PKC activator and candidate Alzheimer's disease therapeutic bryostatin, blocked by the PKCalpha-isozyme blocker Ro 31-8220, and accompanied by increases in the number of "perforated" postsynaptic densities, increased numbers of presynaptic vesicles, and the increased occurrence of double-synapse presynaptic boutons associated with the mushroom spines. These and other confocally imaged immunohistochemical results described here involving PKC substrates indicate that individual mushroom spines provide structural storage sites for long-term associative memory and sites for memory-specific synaptogenesis that involve PKC-regulated changes of spine shape, as well as PKC-regulated changes of pre- and postsynaptic ultrastructure.},

Here we tested the capacity of transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS) applied over the motor cortex during motor practice to increase motor memory formation and retention. Nine healthy individuals underwent a crossover transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study designed to test motor memory formation resulting from training. Anodal tDCS elicited an increase in the magnitude and duration of motor memories in a polarity-specific manner, as reflected by changes in the kinematic characteristics of TMS-evoked movements after anodal, but not cathodal or sham stimulation. This effect was present only when training and stimulation were associated and mediated by a differential modulation of corticomotor excitability of the involved muscles. These results indicate that anodal brain polarization can enhance the initial formation and retention of a new motor memory resulting from training. These processes may be the underlying mechanisms by which tDCS enhances motor learning.},

In particular, the amygdala has been shown to be an essential component of the circuitry underlying fear-related responses. Disorders in the processing of fear-related information are likely to be the underlying cause of some anxiety disorders in humans such as posttraumatic stress. The amygdaloid complex is a group of more than 10 nuclei that are located in the midtemporal lobe. These nuclei can be distinguished both on cytoarchitectonic and connectional grounds. Anatomical tract tracing studies have shown that these nuclei have extensive intranuclear and internuclear connections. The afferent and efferent connections of the amygdala have also been mapped in detail, showing that the amygdaloid complex has extensive connections with cortical and subcortical regions. Analysis of fear conditioning in rats has suggested that long-term synaptic plasticity of inputs to the amygdala underlies the acquisition and perhaps storage of the fear memory. In agreement with this proposal, synaptic plasticity has been demonstrated at synapses in the amygdala in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In this review, we examine the anatomical and physiological substrates proposed to underlie amygdala function.},

In humans, DHEA has antidepressive effects; however, the mechanism is unknown. We examined whether alterations in DHEA also occur in an animal model of depression, the Flinders-sensitive-line (FSL) rats, with the intention of determining the brain site of DHEA action and its antidepressant mechanism. We discovered that DHEA levels were lower in some brain regions involved with depression of FSL rats compared to Sprague\textendash{}Dawley (SD) controls. Moreover, DHEA (1 mg/kg IP for 14 days)-treated FSL rats were more mobile in the forced swim test than FSL controls. In the NAc and VTA, significant changes were observed in the levels of the \ensuremath{\delta}-subunit of GABAA, but not of \ensuremath{\sigma}1R mRNA, in FSL rats compared to SD rats. The \ensuremath{\delta}-subunit controls the sensitivity of the GABAAR to the neurosteroid. Indeed, treatment (14 days) of FSL rats with the GABAA agonist muscimol (0.5 mg/kg), together with DHEA (a negative modulator of GABAA), reversed the effect of DHEA on immobility in the swim test. Perfusion of DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) (3 nM and 30 nM for 14 days) into the VTA and NAc of FSL rats improved their performance in the swim test for at least 3 weeks post-treatment. Our results imply that alterations in DHEA are involved in the pathophysiology of depression and that the antidepressant action of DHEA is mediated via GABAARs in the NAc and VTA.},

Blood samples were collected continuously through indwelling venous catheters. The subjects pressed a signal to indicate the start and finish of orgasm/ejaculation. Objective assessment of sexual arousal and orgasm was obtained by measuring blood-pulse amplitude and electromyographic activity, recorded continuously throughout testing from an anal device containing a photoplethysmograph and electromyograph electrodes connected to a polygraph located in an adjacent room. These measures allowed collection of data from men and women of changes in blood flow and muscle activity in the lower pelvic/pubic area. Plasma OT levels increased during sexual arousal in both women and men and were significantly higher during orgasm/ejaculation than during prior baseline testing. We suggest that the temporal pattern of secretion could be related to smooth muscle contractions of the reproductive system during orgasm.},

The auditory pathways to LA are well characterized, but less is known about the pathways through which foot shock is transmitted. Anatomical tracing and physiological recording studies suggest that the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus, which projects to LA, receives both auditory and somatosensory inputs. In the present study we examined the expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the LA in rats in response to foot-shock stimulation. We then determined the effects of posterior intralaminar thalamic lesions on foot-shock-induced c-Fos expression in the LA. Foot-shock stimulation led to an increase in the density of c-Fos-positive cells in all LA subnuclei in comparison to controls exposed to the conditioning box but not shocked. However, some differences among the dorsolateral, ventrolateral and ventromedial subnuclei were observed. The ventrolateral subnucleus showed a homogeneous activation throughout its antero-posterior extension. In contrast, only the rostral aspect of the ventromedial subnucleus and the central aspect of the dorsolateral subnucleus showed a significant increment in c-Fos expression. The density of c-Fos-labeled cells in all LA subnuclei was also increased in animals placed in the box in comparison to untreated animals. Unilateral electrolytic lesions of the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus and the medial division of the medial geniculate body reduced foot-shock-induced c-Fos activation in the LA ipsilateral to the lesion. The number of c-Fos labeled cells on the lesioned side was reduced to the levels observed in the animals exposed only to the box. These results indicate that the LA is involved in processing information about the foot-shock unconditioned stimulus and receives this kind of somatosensory information from the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus and the medial division of the medial geniculate body.},

  abstract = {Sporulation is a well-studied process executed with varying efficiency by diverse yeast strains. We developed a high-throughput method to quantify yeast sporulation efficiency and used this technique to analyze a line cross between a high-efficiency oak tree isolate and a low-efficiency wine strain. We find that natural variation in sporulation efficiency mirrors natural variation in higher eukaryotes: it shows divergence between isolated populations, arises from loci of major effect, and exhibits epistasis. We show that the lower sporulation efficiency of the wine strain results from a failure to initiate sporulation, rather than from slower kinetics of meiosis and spore formation. The two strains differentially regulate many genes involved in aerobic respiration, an essential pathway for sporulation, such that the oak tree strain appears better poised to generate energy from this pathway. We also report that a polymorphism in RME1 that affects sporulation efficiency in laboratory strains also cosegregates with significant phenotypic differences in our cross of natural isolates. These results lay the groundwork for the study of variation in sporulation efficiency among natural isolates of yeast.},

Despite its increasing use in experimental and clinical settings, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remain unknown. Anodal tDCS applied to the human motor cortex (M1) improves motor skill learning. Here, we demonstrate in mouse M1 slices that DCS induces a long-lasting synaptic potentiation (DCS-LTP), which is polarity specific, NMDA receptor dependent, and requires coupling of DCS with repetitive low-frequency synaptic activation (LFS). Combined DCS and LFS enhance BDNF-secretion and TrkB activation, and DCS-LTP is absent in BDNF and TrkB mutant mice, suggesting that BDNF is a key mediator of this phenomenon. Moreover, the BDNF val66met polymorphism known to partially affect activity-dependent BDNF secretion impairs motor skill acquisition in humans and mice. Motor learning is enhanced by anodal tDCS, as long as activity-dependent BDNF secretion is in place. We propose that tDCS may improve motor skill learning through augmentation of synaptic plasticity that requires BDNF secretion and TrkB activation within M1.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether age-associated alterations in the GABAergic input to pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus are due to a dysfunction of GABAergic interneurons, and/or a decrease in their cholinergic control via nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). Electrophysiological recordings were obtained from pyramidal cells in the CA1 area of hippocampal slices from young (3-4 months old) and aged (25-30 months old) Sprague-Dawley rats. Synaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials induced by stimulation of the stratum oriens were significantly smaller in aged rats. The frequency (but not amplitude) of spontaneous and miniature GABA inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) was reduced in aged rats, suggesting a presynaptic alteration. Tetanic stimulation of cholinergic afferents to release endogenous acetylcholine, or an exogenous application of the nAChR agonist cytisine, increased the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs in young rats; however these effects were not evident in aged rats, indicating that the nicotinic control of GABA release is lowered during aging. None of these age-related alterations were reversed by a chronic treatment with donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor. Immunofluorescent labeling of GABA interneurons with somatostatin (SOM), parvalbumin (PV) or calbindin (CB), together with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter VAChT, revealed a selective loss of subpopulations of SOM and CB positive interneurons. This loss was associated with a general decrease in density of the cholinergic network in aged rats. Thus, the lower GABAergic inhibition observed in the aged rat hippocampus is due to a selective loss/dysfunction of subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons, associated with a widespread cholinergic deficit.},

MEF2 serves as a nuclear sensor, integrating signals from several signaling cascades through protein-protein interactions with kinases, chromatin remodeling factors, and other transcriptional regulators. Here, we report a novel interaction between the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1\ensuremath{\alpha} (PP1\ensuremath{\alpha}) and MEF2. Interaction occurs within the nucleus, and binding of PP1\ensuremath{\alpha} to MEF2 potently represses MEF2-dependent transcription. The interaction utilizes uncharacterized domains in both PP1\ensuremath{\alpha} and MEF2, and PP1\ensuremath{\alpha} phosphatase activity is not obligatory for MEF2 repression. Moreover, a MEF2-PP1\ensuremath{\alpha} regulatory complex leads to nuclear retention and recruitment of histone deacetylase 4 to MEF2 transcription complexes. PP1\ensuremath{\alpha}-mediated repression of MEF2 overrides the positive influence of calcineurin signaling, suggesting PP1\ensuremath{\alpha} exerts a dominant level of control over MEF2 function. Indeed, PP1\ensuremath{\alpha}-mediated repression of MEF2 function interferes with the prosurvival effect of MEF2 in primary hippocampal neurons. The PP1\ensuremath{\alpha}-MEF2 interaction constitutes a potent locus of control for MEF2-dependent gene expression, having potentially important implications for neuronal cell survival, cardiac remodeling in disease, and terminal differentiation of vascular, cardiac, and skeletal muscle.},

  abstract = {A stereological method for obtaining estimates of the total number of neurons in five major subdivisions of the rat hippocampus is described. The new method, the optical fractionator, combines two recent developments in stereology: a three-dimensional probe for counting neuronal nuclei, the optical disector, and a systematic uniform sampling scheme, the fractionator. The optical disector results in unbiased estimates of neuron number, i.e., estimates that are free of assumptions about neuron size and shape, are unaffected by lost caps and overprojection, and approach the true number of neurons in an unlimited manner as the number of samples is increased. The fractionator involves sampling a known fraction of a structural component. In the case of neuron number, a zero dimensional quantity, it provides estimates that are unaffected by shrinkage before, during, and after processing of the tissue. Because the fractionator involves systematic sampling, it also results in highly efficient estimates. Typically only 100-200 neurons must be counted in an animal to obtain a precision that is compatible with experimental studies. The methodology is compared with those used in earlier works involving estimates of neuron number in the rat hippocampus and a number of new stereological methods that have particular relevance to the quantitative study of the structure of the nervous system are briefly described in an appendix.},

Furthermore, local gray matter volume in the same region correlated with both interoceptive accuracy and subjective ratings of visceral awareness.

  abstract = {PURPOSE

The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcome of children with benign partial epilepsy in infancy (BPEI).

METHODS

A telephone-interview survey using a structured questionnaire was conducted with patients who were diagnosed as having possible BPEI at age 2 years and who were 8 years or older at the time of the survey. The data from 39 of 48 patients were available. The median age at the time of the survey was 11.3 years; 18 boys and 21 girls were included.

RESULTS

Three patients had a recurrence of unprovoked seizure beyond age 2 years. Four patients had cognitive problems (mild mental retardation in three and Asperger syndrome in one). An association of paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis was observed in three patients, and another three had experienced seizures associated with mild gastroenteritis. Major behavioral problems were not recognized in any patients. Four patients were excluded from having definite BPEI at age 5 years, and another two were excluded for having definite BPEI at the last follow-up. Eventually, 33 of 39 patients were categorized as having definite BPEI beyond 8 years of age.

CONCLUSIONS

A large majority of patients diagnosed as possibly having BPEI at age 2 years did not have a recurrence of unprovoked seizures and cognitive problems beyond 8 years of age.},

In vegetatively growing yeast, VPS13 is involved in the delivery of proteins to the vacuole. During sporulation, VPS13 is important for formation of the prospore membrane that encapsulates the daughter nuclei to give rise to spores. We report that VPS13 is required for multiple aspects of prospore membrane morphogenesis. VPS13 (1) promotes expansion of the prospore membrane through regulation of phosphatidylinositol phosphates, which in turn activate the phospholipase D, Spo14; (2) is required for a late step in cytokinesis that gives rise to spores; and (3) regulates a membrane-bending activity that generates intralumenal vesicles. These results demonstrate that Vps13 plays a broader role in membrane biology than previously known, which could have important implications for the functions of VPS13 orthologs in humans.},

Adeno-associated viruses are the best current means of labelling and manipulating axons and synapses, but they have never expressed more than one transgene highly enough to label fine axonal structure while also labelling or perturbing synapses. Their slow expression also makes them incompatible with retrograde and transsynaptic vectors, preventing powerful combinatorial experiments. Here we show that deletion-mutant rabies virus can be specifically targeted to cells local to an injection site, brightly labelling axons even when coexpressing two other transgenes. We demonstrate several novel capabilities: simultaneously labelling axons and presynaptic terminals, labelling both dendrites and postsynaptic densities, and simultaneously labelling a region's inputs and outputs using co-injected vectors.},

Here, we demonstrate that activation of adenosine receptors induces a long-lasting increase in the frequency of astrocytic Ca(2+) oscillations in rat hippocampal slice cultures. The long-term facilitation of the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations was mediated by endogenous adenosine generated via breakdown of extracellular ATP by ecto-ATPase. We also demonstrate that local tissue injury with ultraviolet irradiation can cause this long-term facilitation of Ca(2+) oscillations via endogenous adenosine. Our data suggest that endogenous adenosine is one of the modulators of spontaneous astrocytic Ca(2+) oscillations in the rat hippocampus, and may play a significant role in altered Ca(2+) dynamics in astrocytes observed during pathophysiological conditions.},

  abstract = {Behavioural states in mammals, such as the anxious state, are characterized by several features that are coordinately regulated by diverse nervous system outputs, ranging from behavioural choice patterns to changes in physiology (in anxiety, exemplified respectively by risk-avoidance and respiratory rate alterations). Here we investigate if and how defined neural projections arising from a single coordinating brain region in mice could mediate diverse features of anxiety. Integrating behavioural assays, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, respiratory physiology and optogenetics, we identify a surprising new role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the coordinated modulation of diverse anxiety features. First, two BNST subregions were unexpectedly found to exert opposite effects on the anxious state: oval BNST activity promoted several independent anxious state features, whereas anterodorsal BNST-associated activity exerted anxiolytic influence for the same features. Notably, we found that three distinct anterodorsal BNST efferent projections-to the lateral hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus and ventral tegmental area-each implemented an independent feature of anxiolysis: reduced risk-avoidance, reduced respiratory rate, and increased positive valence, respectively. Furthermore, selective inhibition of corresponding circuit elements in freely moving mice showed opposing behavioural effects compared with excitation, and in vivo recordings during free behaviour showed native spiking patterns in anterodorsal BNST neurons that differentiated safe and anxiogenic environments. These results demonstrate that distinct BNST subregions exert opposite effects in modulating anxiety, establish separable anxiolytic roles for different anterodorsal BNST projections, and illustrate circuit mechanisms underlying selection of features for the assembly of the anxious state.},

In vitro and in vivo characterization studies confirm that the HSV-1 H129\textendash{}EGFP retains comparable replication and neuroinvasiveness as the wildtype H129 virus. As a proof of principle we confirm anterograde movement of the H129\textendash{}EGFP along polysynaptic pathways by inoculating the upper airways and tracking time-dependent EGFP expression in previously described ascending sensory pathways. These data confirm a genomic locus for recombining HSV-1 H129 such that normal viral function and replication is maintained.

We investigated whether DS neurons generate an abnormal, APP-dependent GC phenotype in vitro. On laminin, which binds APP and \ensuremath{\beta}1 integrins (Itgb1), DS neurons formed enlarged and faster-advancing GCs compared to controls. On peptide matrices that bind APP only, but not on those binding exclusively Itgb1 or L1CAM, DS GCs were significantly enlarged (2.0-fold), formed increased close adhesions (1.8-fold), and advanced faster (1.4-fold). In assays involving alternating stripes of monospecific matrices, human control GCs exhibited no preference for any of the substrates, whereas DS GCs preferred the APP-binding matrix (cross-over decreased significantly from 48.2 to 27.2\%). Reducing APP expression in DS GCs with siRNA normalized most measures of the phenotype, including substrate choice. These experiments show that human DS neurons exhibit an APP-dependent, abnormal GC phenotype characterized by increased adhesion and altered contact guidance. The results suggest that APP overexpression may perturb axonal pathfinding and circuit formation in developing DS brain.},

  abstract = {NMDA receptor activation has been implicated in modulating seizure activity; however, its complete role in the development of epilepsy is unknown. The pilocarpine model of limbic epilepsy involves inducing status epilepticus (SE) with the subsequent development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) and is widely accepted as a model of limbic epilepsy in humans. The pilocarpine model of epilepsy provides a tool for looking at the molecular signals triggered by SE that are responsible for the development of epilepsy. In this study, we wanted to examine the role of NMDA receptor activation on the development of epilepsy using the pilocarpine model. Pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 does not block the onset of SE in the pilocarpine model. Thus, we could compare animals that experience similar lengths of SE in the presence or absence of NMDA receptor activation. Animals treated with MK-801 (4 mg/kg) 20 min prior to pilocarpine (350 mg/kg) (MK-Pilo) were compared to the pilocarpine treated epileptic animals 3-8 weeks after the initial episode of SE. The pilocarpine-treated animals displayed both ictal activity and interictal spikes on EEG analysis, whereas MK-801-pilocarpine and control animals only exhibited normal background EEG patterns. In addition, MK-801-pilocarpine animals did not exhibit any SRSs, while pilocarpine-treated animals exhibited 4.8 +/- 1 seizures per 40 h. MK-801-pilocarpine animals did not demonstrate any decrease in pyramidal cell number in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus, while pilocarpine animals averaged 15\% decrease in cell number. In summary, the MK-801-pilocarpine animals exhibited a number of characteristics similar to control animals and were statistically significantly different from pilocarpine-treated animals. Thus, NMDA receptor inhibition by MK-801 prevented the development of epilepsy and interictal activity following SE. These results indicate that NMDA receptor activation is required for epileptogenesis following SE in this model of limbic epilepsy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) recorded during cognitive tasks has been shown to differentiate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy individuals. However, the association between various qEEG markers recorded during mnestic paradigms and clinical measures of AD has not been studied in detail.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if 'cognitive' qEEG is a useful diagnostic option, particularly if memory paradigms are used as cognitive stimulators.
METHODS: This study is part of the Prospective Registry on Dementia in Austria (PRODEM), a multicenter dementia research project. A cohort of 79 probable AD patients was included in a cross-sectional analysis. qEEG recordings performed in resting states were compared with recordings during cognitively active states. Cognition was evoked with a face-name paradigm and a paired-associate word list task, respectively. Relative band powers, coherence and auto-mutual information were computed as functions of MMSE scores for the memory paradigms and during rest. Analyses were adjusted for the co-variables age, sex, duration of dementia and educational level.
RESULTS: MMSE scores explained 36-51\% of the variances of qEEG-markers. Face-name encoding with eyes open was superior to resting state with eyes closed in relative theta and beta1 power as well as coherence, whereas relative alpha power and auto-mutual information yielded more significant results during resting state with eyes closed. The face-name task yielded stronger correlations with MMSE scores than the verbal memory task.
CONCLUSION: qEEG alterations recorded during mnestic activity, particularly face-name encoding showed the highest association with the MMSE and may serve as a clinically valuable marker for disease severity.},

  abstract = {Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for systems neuroscience. Here we describe red, single-wavelength GECIs, ``RCaMPs,'' engineered from circular permutation of the thermostable red fluorescent protein mRuby. High-resolution crystal structures of mRuby, the red sensor RCaMP, and the recently published red GECI R-GECO1 give insight into the chromophore environments of the Ca2+-bound state of the sensors and the engineered protein domain interfaces of the different indicators. We characterized the biophysical properties and performance of RCaMP sensors in vitro and in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila larvae, and larval zebrafish. Further, we demonstrate 2-color calcium imaging both within the same cell (registering mitochondrial and somatic [Ca2+]) and between two populations of cells: neurons and astrocytes. Finally, we perform integrated optogenetics experiments, wherein neural activation via channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or a red-shifted variant, and activity imaging via RCaMP or GCaMP, are conducted simultaneously, with the ChR2/RCaMP pair providing independently addressable spectral channels. Using this paradigm, we measure calcium responses of naturalistic and ChR2-evoked muscle contractions in vivo in crawling C. elegans. We systematically compare the RCaMP sensors to R-GECO1, in terms of action potential-evoked fluorescence increases in neurons, photobleaching, and photoswitching. R-GECO1 displays higher Ca2+ affinity and larger dynamic range than RCaMP, but exhibits significant photoactivation with blue and green light, suggesting that integrated channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics using R-GECO1 may be subject to artifact. Finally, we create and test blue, cyan, and yellow variants engineered from GCaMP by rational design. This engineered set of chromatic variants facilitates new experiments in functional imaging and optogenetics.},

After 2 weeks of preliminary examination, 30 subjects were randomized into two 15-person groups, one of which was given Yamabushitake and the other given a placebo. The subjects of the Yamabushitake group took four 250 mg tablets containing 96\% of Yamabushitake dry powder three times a day for 16 weeks. After termination of the intake, the subjects were observed for the next 4 weeks. At weeks 8, 12 and 16 of the trial, the Yamabushitake group showed significantly increased scores on the cognitive function scale compared with the placebo group. The Yamabushitake group's scores increased with the duration of intake, but at week 4 after the termination of the 16 weeks intake, the scores decreased significantly. Laboratory tests showed no adverse effect of Yamabushitake. The results obtained in this study suggest that Yamabushitake is effective in improving mild cognitive impairment.},

The auditory pathways to LA are well characterized, but less is known about the pathways through which foot shock is transmitted. Anatomical tracing and physiological recording studies suggest that the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus, which projects to LA, receives both auditory and somatosensory inputs. In the present study we examined the expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the LA in rats in response to foot-shock stimulation. We then determined the effects of posterior intralaminar thalamic lesions on foot-shock-induced c-Fos expression in the LA. Foot-shock stimulation led to an increase in the density of c-Fos-positive cells in all LA subnuclei in comparison to controls exposed to the conditioning box but not shocked. However, some differences among the dorsolateral, ventrolateral and ventromedial subnuclei were observed. The ventrolateral subnucleus showed a homogeneous activation throughout its antero-posterior extension. In contrast, only the rostral aspect of the ventromedial subnucleus and the central aspect of the dorsolateral subnucleus showed a significant increment in c-Fos expression. The density of c-Fos-labeled cells in all LA subnuclei was also increased in animals placed in the box in comparison to untreated animals. Unilateral electrolytic lesions of the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus and the medial division of the medial geniculate body reduced foot-shock-induced c-Fos activation in the LA ipsilateral to the lesion. The number of c-Fos labeled cells on the lesioned side was reduced to the levels observed in the animals exposed only to the box. These results indicate that the LA is involved in processing information about the foot-shock unconditioned stimulus and receives this kind of somatosensory information from the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus and the medial division of the medial geniculate body.},

Large spines contacted by thalamic afferents exhibited larger Ca2+ transients during action potential backpropagation than did small spines contacted by cortical afferents. Accordingly, induction of Hebbian plasticity, dependent on postsynaptic spikes, was restricted to thalamic afferents. This synapse-specific effect involved activation of R-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels preferentially located at thalamic inputs. These results indicate that afferent-specific mechanisms of postsynaptic, associative Hebbian plasticity in LA projection neurons depend on local, spine-specific morphological and molecular properties, rather than global differences between dendritic compartments.},

Epileptic tolerance has been demonstrated using a variety of seizure preconditioning paradigms, including electroconvulsive shocks and low doses of excitotoxins such as kainic acid. The cell and molecular mechanisms underlying the protection are not fully understood but proposed mediators include the transcription factor Nf\ensuremath{\kappa}B, altered ion channel expression, upregulation of growth factors and other protective genes, and suppression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Application of microarrays to profile the transcriptome of seizure-preconditioning and tolerance has provided further insights, including roles for chromatin remodeling and evidence that preconditioning generates an anti-excitotoxicity phenotype by reprogramming the transcriptional response to status epilepticus. This review summarizes the various animal models of epileptic tolerance, reviews the key effector(s) and the utility of this experimental paradigm for identifying novel targets for neuroprotection and anti-epileptogenesis.},

The present study was designed to assess, within the same group of old animals, the behavioral, electrophysiological and neurochemical effects of chronic treatment with agents that increase the function of the cholinergic system through both muscarinic and nicotinic mechanisms. Doses were determined that produced 60\% cholinesterase inhibition by donepezil and galantamine for the old rats. This was chosen to be analogous to therapeutic levels achieved for treatment of human Alzheimer's disease patients with these agents. Because of the well-known age-related changes in spatial memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, spatial working memory in the radial eight-arm maze and hippocampal long-term potentiation induction and decay, as well as nicotinic receptor density and affinity, were measured in old rats implanted with minipumps that delivered donepezil, galantamine or saline. There was no effect of drug treatment on baseline synaptic transmission or on the threshold or magnitude of long-term potentiation induction. Both drug treatment groups, however, showed significantly extended long-term potentiation decay times at the perforant path\textendash{}granule cell synapse over the saline control animals, as measured during the week following induction. Both drugs also elevated the number of nicotinic receptors within the hippocampus and neocortex. This is the first demonstration of cholinergic modulation of synaptic plasticity over the time-course of days. Furthermore, the durability of long-term potentiation was significantly, positively correlated with nicotinic receptor binding in the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with donepezil or galantamine had no significant effect on a well-learned spatial working memory task on the radial maze. These data suggest that the therapeutic doses of cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease may have effects on neurophysiology and neurochemistry that are close to the threshold for producing detectable behavioral improvements.},

  abstract = {The effects recurring seizures have on the developing brain are an important area of debate because many forms of human epilepsy arise in early life when the central nervous system is undergoing dramatic developmental changes. To examine effects on glutamatergic synaptogenesis, epileptiform activity was induced by chronic treatment with GABAa receptor antagonists in slice cultures made from infant rat hippocampus. Experiments in control cultures showed that molecular markers for glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses recapitulated developmental milestones reported previously in vivo. Following a 1-week treatment with bicuculline, the intensity of epileptiform activity that could be induced in cultures was greatly diminished, suggesting induction of an adaptive response. In keeping with this notion, immunoblotting revealed the expression of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits was dramatically reduced along with the scaffolding proteins, PSD95 and Homer. These effects could not be attributed to neuronal cell death, were reversible, and were not observed in slices taken from older animals. Co-treating slices with APV or TTX abolished the effects of bicuculline suggesting that effects were dependent on NMDA receptors and neuronal activity. Neurophysiological recordings supported the biochemical findings and demonstrated decreases in both the amplitude and frequency of NMDA and AMPA receptor-mediated miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). Taken together these results suggest that neuronal network hyperexcitability interferes with the normal maturation of glutamatergic synapses, which could have implications for cognitive deficits commonly associated with the severe epilepsies of early childhood.},

These enzymes were much less concentrated in the cortical, medial, central, and basomedial nuclei.

In response to increased neuronal activity, calcium influx into neurons induced the activation of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylated and activated MEF2. When activated, MEF2 promoted the transcription of a set of genes, including arc and synGAP, that restrict synapse number.

  abstract = {Although the circuit mediating contextual fear conditioning has been extensively described, the precise contribution that specific anatomical nodes make to behavior has not been fully elucidated. To clarify the roles of the dorsal hippocampus (DH), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in contextual fear conditioning, activity within these regions was mapped using cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity using fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) for Arc mRNA. Rats were delay-fear conditioned or immediately shocked (controls) and thereafter reexposed to the shocked context to test for fear memory recall. Subsequent catFISH analyses revealed that in the DH, cells were preferentially reactivated during the context test, regardless of whether animals had been fear conditioned or immediately shocked, suggesting that the DH encodes spatial information specifically, rather then the emotional valence of an environment. In direct contrast, neuronal ensembles in the BLA were only reactivated at test if animals had been fear conditioned, suggesting that the amygdala specifically tracks the emotional properties of a context. Interestingly, Arc expression in the mPFC was consistent with both amygdala- and hippocampus-like patterns, supporting a role for the mPFC in both fear and contextual processing. Collectively, these data provide crucial insight into the region-specific behavior of neuronal ensembles during contextual fear conditioning and demonstrate a dissociable role for the hippocampus and amygdala in processing the contextual and emotional properties of a fear memory.},

However, the cis-acting elements responsible for such stringent activity dependence have not been firmly identified. Here we combined luciferase reporter assays in cultured cortical neurons and comparative genome mapping to identify the critical synaptic activity-responsive elements (SARE) of the Arc/Arg-3.1 gene. A major SARE was found as a unique approximately 100-bp element located at \ensuremath{>}5 kb upstream of the Arc/Arg-3.1 transcription initiation site in the mouse genome. This single element, when positioned immediately upstream of a minimal promoter, was necessary and sufficient to replicate crucial properties of endogenous Arc/Arg-3.1's transcriptional regulation, including rapid onset of transcription triggered by synaptic activity and low basal expression during synaptic inactivity. We identified the major determinants of SARE as a unique cluster of neuronal activity-dependent cis-regulatory elements consisting of closely localized binding sites for CREB, MEF2, and SRF. Consistently, a SARE reporter could readily trace and mark an ensemble of cells that have experienced intense activity in the recent past in vivo. Taken together, our work uncovers a novel transcriptional mechanism by which a critical 100-bp element, SARE, mediates a predominant component of the synapse-to-nucleus signaling in ensembles of Arc/Arg-3.1-positive activated neurons.},

  abstract = {The GABA(A) receptor is a heterooligomeric protein complex composed of multiple receptor subunits. Developmental changes in the pattern of expression of 11 GABA(A) receptor subunits in individual rat embryonic hippocampal neurons on days 1-21 in culture and acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons from postnatal day (PND) 5 rat pups were investigated using the technique of single-cell mRNA amplification. We demonstrate that multiple GABA(A) receptor subunits are expressed within individual hippocampal neurons, with most cells simultaneously expressing alpha1, alpha2, alpha5, beta1, and gamma2 mRNAs. Further, relative expression of several GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs changes significantly in embryonic hippocampal neurons during in vitro development, with the relative abundance (compared with beta-actin) of alpha1, alpha5, and gamma2 mRNAs increasing 2.3-, 2.7-, and 3.8-fold, respectively, from days 1 to 14, and beta1 increasing 5-fold from days 1 to 21. In situ hybridization with antisense digoxigenin-labeled alpha1, beta1, and gamma2 RNA probes demonstrates a similar increase in expression of subunit mRNAs as embryonic hippocampal neurons mature in vitro. Relative abundances of alpha1, beta1, and gamma2 subunit mRNAs in acutely dissociated PND 5 hippocampal neurons are also significantly greater than in embryonic day 17 neurons on day 1 in vitro and exceed the peak values seen in cultured neurons on days 14-21, suggesting that GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA expression within individual hippocampal neurons follows a similar, if somewhat delayed, developmental pattern in vitro compared with in vivo. These findings suggest that embryonic hippocampal neuronal culture provides a useful model in which to study the developmental regulation of GABA(A) receptor expression and that developmental changes in GABA(A) receptor subunit expression may underlie some of the differences in functional properties of GABA(A) receptors in neonatal and mature hippocampal neurons.},

Functional in vivo two-photon Ca(2+) imaging revealed that the sensitivity of dendritic Ca(2+) signals to stimulus location in visual space is correlated with their anatomical position within the dendritic tree of individual neurons. This topographic distribution was dependent on NMDAR activation, whereas global Ca(2+) signals were mediated by Ca(2+) influx through dendritic, voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels. These findings suggest a framework for plasticity models that invoke local dendritic Ca(2+) signaling in the elaboration of neural connectivity and dendrite-specific information storage.},

Seizure incidence during the human lifespan is at its highest in infancy and childhood. Animal models of epilepsy and human tissue studies suggest that epileptogenesis involves a cascade of molecular, cellular and neuronal network alterations. Within minutes to days following the initial insult, there are acute early changes in neuronal networks, which include rapid alterations to ion channel kinetics as a result of membrane depolarization, post-translational modifications to existing functional proteins, and activation of immediate early genes. Subacute changes occur over hours to weeks, and include transcriptional events, neuronal death and activation of inflammatory cascades. The chronic changes that follow over weeks to months include anatomical changes, such as neurogenesis, mossy fiber sprouting, network reorganization, and gliosis. These epileptogenic processes are developmentally regulated and might contribute to differences in epileptogenesis between adult and developing brains. Here we review the factors responsible for enhanced seizure susceptibility in the developing brain, and consider age-specific mechanisms of epileptogenesis. An understanding of these factors could yield potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of epileptogenesis and also provide biomarkers for identifying patients at risk of developing epilepsy or for monitoring disease progression.},

It has been studied under various induction protocols and depends on firing rates, membrane voltage, and precise timing of action potentials. These protocols show different facets of a common underlying mechanism but they are mostly modeled as distinct phenomena. Here, we show that all of these different dependencies can be explained from a single computational principle. The objective is a sparse distribution of excitatory synaptic strength, which may help to reduce metabolic costs associated with synaptic transmission. Based on this objective we derive a stochastic gradient ascent learning rule which is of differential-Hebbian type. It is formulated in biophysical quantities and can be related to current mechanistic theories of synaptic plasticity. The learning rule accounts for experimental findings from all major induction protocols and explains a classic phenomenon of metaplasticity. Furthermore, our model predicts the existence of metaplasticity for spike-timing-dependent plasticity Thus, we provide a theory of long-term synaptic plasticity that unifies different induction protocols and provides a connection between functional and mechanistic levels of description.},

The magnitudes of the ensuing Ca2+ transients within dendritic spines are thought to determine the amplitude and direction of synaptic change. In contrast, we show that at mature hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses the magnitudes of Ca2+ transients during plasticity induction do not match this rule. Indeed, LTP induced by time-correlated pre- and postsynaptic spikes instead requires the sequential activation of NMDARs followed by voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels within dendritic spines. Furthermore, LTP requires inhibition of SK channels by mGluR1, which removes a negative feedback loop that constitutively regulates NMDARs. Therefore, rather than being controlled simply by the magnitude of the postsynaptic calcium rise, LTP induction requires the coordinated activation of distinct sources of Ca2+ and mGluR1-dependent facilitation of NMDAR function.},

  abstract = {Behavioural states in mammals, such as the anxious state, are characterized by several features that are coordinately regulated by diverse nervous system outputs, ranging from behavioural choice patterns to changes in physiology (in anxiety, exemplified respectively by risk-avoidance and respiratory rate alterations). Here we investigate if and how defined neural projections arising from a single coordinating brain region in mice could mediate diverse features of anxiety. Integrating behavioural assays, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, respiratory physiology and optogenetics, we identify a surprising new role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the coordinated modulation of diverse anxiety features. First, two BNST subregions were unexpectedly found to exert opposite effects on the anxious state: oval BNST activity promoted several independent anxious state features, whereas anterodorsal BNST-associated activity exerted anxiolytic influence for the same features. Notably, we found that three distinct anterodorsal BNST efferent projections\textemdash{}to the lateral hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus and ventral tegmental area\textemdash{}each implemented an independent feature of anxiolysis: reduced risk-avoidance, reduced respiratory rate, and increased positive valence, respectively. Furthermore, selective inhibition of corresponding circuit elements in freely moving mice showed opposing behavioural effects compared with excitation, and in vivo recordings during free behaviour showed native spiking patterns in anterodorsal BNST neurons that differentiated safe and anxiogenic environments. These results demonstrate that distinct BNST subregions exert opposite effects in modulating anxiety, establish separable anxiolytic roles for different anterodorsal BNST projections, and illustrate circuit mechanisms underlying selection of features for the assembly of the anxious state.},

Yet it is not well understood how this behavior is organized early in development and how it relates to the response properties of the developing visual system.

We found that, during early development, visual avoidance\textemdash{}an innate, tectally mediated behavior\textemdash{}is tuned to a specific stimulus size and is sensitive to changes in contrast. Using in vivo recordings we found that developmental changes in the spatial tuning of visual avoidance are mirrored by changes in tectal receptive field sharpness and the temporal properties of subthreshold visual responses, whereas contrast sensitivity is affected by the gain of the visual response. We also show that long- and short-term perturbations of visual response properties predictably alter behavioral output. We conclude that our assay for visual avoidance is a useful functional measure of the developmental state of the tectal circuitry. We use this assay to show that the developing visual system is tuned to facilitate behavioral output and that the system can be modulated by neural activity, allowing it to adapt to environmental changes it encounters during development.},

This allowed us to identify collections of brain regions where Fos expression co-varies across mice, and presumably form components of a network that are co-active during recall of long-term fear memory. This analysis suggested that expression of a long-term fear memory is an emergent property of large scale neural network interactions. This network has a distinct thalamic-hippocampal-cortical signature and, like many real-world networks as well as other anatomical and functional brain networks, has small-world architecture with a subset of highly-connected hub nodes that may play more central roles in memory expression.},

  abstract = {Extinction of conditioned fear is an active learning process involving inhibition of fear expression. It has been proposed that fear extinction potentiates neurons in the infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex, but the cellular mechanisms underlying this potentiation remain unknown. It is also not known whether this potentiation occurs locally in IL neurons as opposed to IL afferents. To determine whether extinction enhances the intrinsic excitability of IL pyramidal neurons in layers II/III and V, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in slices from naive, conditioned, or conditioned-extinguished rats. We observed that conditioning depressed IL excitability compared with slices from naive animals, as evidenced by a decreased number of spikes evoked by injected current and an increase in the slow afterhyperpolarizing potential (sAHP). Extinction reversed these conditioning-induced effects. Furthermore, IL neurons from extinguished rats showed increased burst spiking compared with naive rats, which was correlated with extinction recall. These changes were specific to IL prefrontal cortex and were not observed in prelimbic prefrontal cortex. Together, these findings suggest that IL intrinsic excitability is reduced to allow for expression of conditioning memory and enhanced for expression of extinction memory through the modulation of Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channels underlying the sAHP. Inappropriate modulation of these intrinsic mechanisms may underlie anxiety disorders, characterized by exaggerated fear and deficient extinction.},

OBJECTIVE: To clarify these inconsistencies in the literature, we conducted a comprehensive effect-size analysis to evaluate the efficacy of MBT.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of studies published in journals or in dissertations in PubMED or PsycINFO from the first available date until May 10, 2013.
REVIEW METHODS: A total of 209 studies (n=12,145) were included.
RESULTS: Effect-size estimates suggested that MBT is moderately effective in pre-post comparisons (n=72; Hedge's g=.55), in comparisons with waitlist controls (n=67; Hedge's g=.53), and when compared with other active treatments (n=68; Hedge's g=.33), including other psychological treatments (n=35; Hedge's g=.22). MBT did not differ from traditional CBT or behavioral therapies (n=9; Hedge's g=-.07) or pharmacological treatments (n=3; Hedge's g=.13).
CONCLUSION: MBT is an effective treatment for a variety of psychological problems, and is especially effective for reducing anxiety, depression, and stress.},

While it has been long held that the GABAergic inhibitory transmission largely varies with the subtype identity of presynaptic interneurons, whether such a rule also applies to STi is largely unknown. Here, by paired recording of interneuron and their neighboring projection neuron in lateral amygdala, we found that relative to the fast spiking and late spiking interneurons, the STi-evoked unitary postsynaptic currents onto the projection neurons had markedly larger amplitude, shorter onset latency and faster rising and decay kinetics. The quantal content and the number of vesicles in the readily releasable pool were also larger in synapses made by STi versus other interneurons. Moreover, the short-term plasticity, as reflected by the paired pulse depression and depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, was the least prominent in the output synapses of STi. Thus, the fast and robust inhibition together with its low capacity of short term modulation may suggest an important role for STi in preventing the overexcitation of the projection neurons and thus gating the information traffic in amygdala.},

In recent years evidence from animal studies has been accumulated that metaplasticity significantly contributes to network function and behavior. Here, we review the evidence for metaplasticity at the system level of the human cortex as investigated by non-invasive brain stimulation. These studies support the notion that metaplasticity is also operative in the human brain and is mostly homeostatic in nature, that is, keeping network activity within a physiological range. However, non-homeostatic metaplasticity has also been described, which can increase non-invasive brain stimulation-induced aftereffects on cortical excitability, or learning. Current evidence further suggests that aberrant metaplasticity may underlie some neurological and psychiatric diseases. Finally, first proof-of-principle studies show that the concept of metaplasticity can be harnessed for treatment of patients suffering from brain diseases.},

The last decade of neuroepigenetic research has primarily focused on learning-induced changes in DNA methylation and chromatin modifications. Numerous studies have independently demonstrated the importance of epigenetic modifications in memory formation and retention as well as Hebbian plasticity. However, how these mechanisms operate in the context of other forms of plasticity is largely unknown. In this review, we examine evidence for epigenetic regulation of Hebbian plasticity. We then discuss how non-Hebbian forms of plasticity, such as intrinsic plasticity and synaptic scaling, may also be involved in producing the cellular adaptations necessary for learning-related behavioral change. Furthermore, we consider the likely roles for transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of these plasticities. In doing so, we aim to expand upon the idea that epigenetic mechanisms are critical regulators of both Hebbian and non-Hebbian forms of plasticity that ultimately drive learning and memory.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: QEEG could provide physiological biomarkers for changes over time in Parkinson's disease (PD) cognitive decline if they track with longitudinal neuropsychological performance.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to correlate longitudinal changes in frequency domain quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) measures with change in neuropsychological performance testing in PD.
METHODS: 71 PD subjects, not demented at baseline, were studied from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders cohort. Baseline and follow-up digital EEG from PD subjects were analyzed for QEEG measures of background rhythm frequency and global relative power in delta (2.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) bands. Baseline and subsequent evaluation included Mini Mental Status Examination and five other neuropsychological tests that load on cognitive domains known to decline in PD. Pearson coefficient was used to assess correlations. Multiple linear regression modeling was used to assess the effect of variable combinations of QEEG and other measures, including age and PD duration.
RESULTS: Changes in delta bandpower showed the highest and most consistent pattern of correlations with longitudinal changes in neuropsychological testing. The highest correlation was between delta bandpower increase and decline in the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (-0.59:p \ensuremath{<} 0.001). Delta bandpower was also increased in the incident dementia group compared to non-dementia at followup.
CONCLUSIONS: 1) Longitudinal change in the QEEG frequency domain measure of delta bandpower correlated best with longitudinal neuropsychological performance change in PD; 2) These results constitute preliminary evidence that delta bandpower may be a suitable biomarker for evaluating PD cognitive deterioration longitudinally.},

Whether they induce death of hippocampal and amygdala neurons and consequent limbic (temporal lobe) epilepsy has remained controversial, with conflicting data from prospective and retrospective studies. Using an appropriate-age rat model of febrile seizures, we investigated the acute and chronic effects of hyperthermic seizures on neuronal integrity and survival in the hippocampus and amygdala via molecular and neuroanatomical methods. Hyperthermic seizures-but not hyperthermia alone-resulted in numerous argyrophilic neurons in discrete regions of the limbic system; within 24 hr of seizures, a significant proportion of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala and in the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell layer were affected. These physicochemical alterations of hippocampal and amygdala neurons persisted for at least 2 weeks but were not accompanied by significant DNA fragmentation, as determined by in situ end labeling. By 4 weeks after the seizures, no significant neuronal dropout in these regions was evident. In conclusion, in the immature rat model, hyperthermic seizures lead to profound, yet primarily transient alterations in neuronal structure.},

PTZ seizures were prevented by GVG injections in the anterior thalamus, the caudal hypothalamus, the superior colliculus, cerebellar nuclei, and in a large area of the medial medullary, pontine, and mesencephalic tegmentum encompassing the vestibular nuclei, the reticular formation, and portions of the central gray. GVG injections in the substantia nigra did not protect against PTZ seizures. In contrast, tonic hindlimb extension in MES was prevented consistently by injections in the substantia nigra. A minority of injections in the vestibular nuclei, cerebellar nuclei, and parts of the reticular formation also protected against tonic hindlimb extension of MES. These results indicate a striking difference in the functional anatomy of PTZ-induced seizures and MES. PTZ seizures appear to be mediated by an extensive system involving the reticular formation, diencephalic regions in the vicinity of the anterior medial thalamus and caudal hypothalamus, and bulbar regions which give rise to descending motor pathways to the spinal cord. In contrast to PTZ seizures, MES appears to be mediated by a different neuroanatomical substrate with the present data implicating only the substantia nigra definitely in that process.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that employs mindfulness meditation to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. The program, nonreligious and nonesoteric, is based upon a systematic procedure to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience of perceptible mental processes. The approach assumes that greater awareness will provide more veridical perception, reduce negative affect and improve vitality and coping. In the last two decades, a number of research reports appeared that seem to support many of these claims. We performed a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies of health-related studies related to MBSR.
METHODS: Sixty-four empirical studies were found, but only 20 reports met criteria of acceptable quality or relevance to be included in the meta-analysis. Reports were excluded due to (1) insufficient information about interventions, (2) poor quantitative health evaluation, (3) inadequate statistical analysis, (4) mindfulness not being the central component of intervention, or (5) the setting of intervention or sample composition deviating too widely from the health-related MBSR program. Acceptable studies covered a wide spectrum of clinical populations (e.g., pain, cancer, heart disease, depression, and anxiety), as well as stressed nonclinical groups. Both controlled and observational investigations were included. Standardized measures of physical and mental well-being constituted the dependent variables of the analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, both controlled and uncontrolled studies showed similar effect sizes of approximately 0.5 (P\ensuremath{<}.0001) with homogeneity of distribution.
CONCLUSION: Although derived from a relatively small number of studies, these results suggest that MBSR may help a broad range of individuals to cope with their clinical and nonclinical problems.},

  abstract = {We have shown that the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) gK gene is essential for efficient replication and spread in the corneal epithelium and trigeminal ganglion neuroinvasion in mice (A. T. David, A. Baghian, T. P. Foster, V. N. Chouljenko, and K. G. Kousoulas, Curr. Eye Res. 33:455-467, 2008). To further investigate the role of gK in neuronal infection, we utilized a microfluidic chamber system separating neuronal cell bodies and axonal termini. HSV-1 (McKrae) engineered virus constitutively expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP) was efficiently transmitted in both a retrograde and an anterograde manner. These results were corroborated by expression of virion structural proteins in either chamber, as well as detection of viral genomes and infectious viruses. In contrast, efficient infection of either chamber with a gK-null virus did not result in infection of the apposed chamber. These results show that gK is an important determinant in virion axonal infection. Moreover, the inability of the gK-null virus to be transmitted in an anterograde manner suggests that virions acquire cytoplasmic envelopes prior to entering axons.
IMPORTANCE: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) enters mucosal epithelial cells and neurons via fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes, mediated by viral glycoprotein B (gB) in cooperation with other viral glycoproteins. Retrograde transport of virions to neuronal cell bodies (somata) establishes lifelong latent infection in ganglionic neurons. We have previously reported that gK binds gB and is required for gB-mediated membrane fusion (Jambunatathan et al., J. Virol. 85:12910-12918, 2011; V. N. Chouljenko, A. V. Iyer, S. Chowdhury, J. Kim, and K. G. Kousoulas, J. Virol. 84:8596-8606, 2010). In the current study, we constructed a recombinant virus with the gK gene deleted in the highly virulent ocular HSV-1 strain McKrae. This recombinant virus failed to infect rat ganglionic neuronal axons alone or cocultured with Vero cells in microfluidic chambers. In addition, lack of gK expression prevented anterograde transmission of virions. These results suggest that gK is a critical determinant for neuronal infection and transmission.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor reading efficiency is the most persistent problem for adults with developmental dyslexia. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between left posterior temporal cortex (pTC) function and reading ability, regardless of dyslexia status.
OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: In this study, we tested whether enhancing left lateralization of pTC using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves reading efficiency in adults without dyslexia.
METHOD: Twenty-five right-handed adults with no history of learning disorder participated. Real and sham "Left lateralizing" tDCS were applied to the pTC in separate sessions. Standardized word and nonword reading tests were given immediately after stimulation.
RESULTS: Modeling of the induced electrical field confirmed that tDCS was likely to increase left pTC excitability and reduce right pTC excitability as intended. Relative to sham, real tDCS induced improvements in word reading efficiency in below average readers.
CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing left lateralization of the pTC using tDCS improves word reading efficiency in below-average readers. This demonstrates that left lateralization of the pTC plays a role in reading ability, and provides stimulation parameters that could be used for a trial of tDCS in adults with developmental dyslexia. Such short-term gains could amplify the effect of appropriate reading interventions when performed in conjunction with them.},

There is an extensive literature on how specific types of memory engage different parts of the brain, and how neurons in these regions process and store information. Until recently, however, the mechanisms that determine how specific cells and synapses within a neural circuit (and not their neighbors) are recruited during learning have received little attention. Recent findings suggest that memory allocation is not random, but rather specific mechanisms regulate where information is stored within a neural circuit. New methods that allow tagging, imaging, activation, and inactivation of neurons in behaving animals promise to revolutionize studies of brain circuits, including memory allocation. Results from these studies are likely to have a considerable impact on computer science, as well as on the understanding of memory and its disorders.},

  isbn = {0-8058-4300-0},
  abstract = {Donald Hebb pioneered many current themes in behavioural neuroscience. He saw psychology as a biological science, but one in which the organization of behaviour must remain the central concern. Through penetrating theoretical concepts, including the "cell assembly," "phase sequence," and "Hebb synapse," he offered a way to bridge the gap between cells, circuits and behaviour. He saw the brain as a dynamically organized system of multiple distributed parts, with roots that extend into foundations of development and evolutionary heritage. He understood that behaviour, as brain, can be sliced at various levels and that one of our challenges is to bring these levels into both conceptual and empirical register. He could move between theory and fact with an ease that continues to inspire both students and professional investigators. Although facts continue to accumulate at an accelerating rate in both psychology and neuroscience, and although these facts continue to force revision in the details of Hebb's earlier contributions, his overall insistence that we look at behaviour and brain together \textemdash{} within a dynamic, relational and multilayered framework \textemdash{} remains. His work touches upon current studies of population coding, contextual factors in brain representations, synaptic plasticity, developmental construction of brain/behaviour relations, clinical syndromes, deterioration of performance with age and disease, and the formal construction of connectionist models. The collection of papers in this volume represent these and related themes that Hebb inspired. We also acknowledge our appreciation for Don Hebb as teacher, colleague and friend.},

  abstract = {Immunohistochemistry is a ubiquitous technique in histology. Often, the goal of such studies is the quantification of some parameter associated with a particular antigen. When used correctly, the optical disector offers a statistically relevant approach to achieve this goal without bias from cell size, shape, or orientation. This three-dimensional counting probe is virtually embedded within the depth of the tissue section, thus avoiding sampling near the cut surfaces of the section, where cells are often lost during the cutting and subsequent processing steps. It follows that the probability that a cell could be immunolabeled should be equal throughout the section depth to correctly employ the optical disector. In this report, we demonstrate that parameters commonly used in immunohistochemistry often leave the middle of the section unlabeled. Furthermore, the degree of incomplete penetration varies among antibodies but can be overcome in some cases by extending the incubation time of the secondary antibody. The detection of this phenomenon in immunofluorescence preparations and the implications of these findings for quantitative stereology using the optical disector are discussed.

  doi = {10.3389/fncel.2012.00021},
  abstract = {There is growing realization that the relationship between memory and stress/emotionality is complicated, and may include both memory enhancing and memory impairing aspects. It has been suggested that the underlying mechanisms involve amygdala modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP). We recently reported that while in CA1 basolateral amygdala (BLA) priming impaired theta stimulation induced LTP, it enhanced LTP in the dentate gyrus (DG). However, emotional and stressfull experiences were found to activate synaptic plasticity within the BLA, raising the possibility that BLA modulation of other brain regions may be altered as well, as it may depend on the way the BLA is activated or is responding. In previous studies BLA priming stimulation was relatively weak (1 V, 50 \ensuremath{\mu}s pulse duration). In the present study we assessed the effects of two stronger levels of BLA priming stimulation (1 V or 2 V, 100 \ensuremath{\mu}s pulse duration) on LTP induction in hippocampal DG and CA1, in anesthetized rats. Results show that 1V-BLA priming stimulation enhanced but 2V-BLA priming stimulation impaired DG LTP; however, both levels of BLA priming stimulation impaired CA1 LTP, suggesting that modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by amygdala is dependent on the degree of amygdala activation. These findings suggest that plasticity-induced within the amygdala, by stressful experiences induces a form of metaplasticity that would alter the way the amygdala may modulate memory-related processes in other brain areas, such as the hippocampus.},

LMT-Cs exhibited two types of long-term rearrangements in connectivity in the adult: progressive expansion of LMT-C subsets along individual dendrites throughout life, and pronounced increases in LMT-C complexities in response to an enriched environment. In organotypic slice cultures, subsets of LMT-Cs also rearranged extensively and grew over weeks and months, altering the strength of preexisting connectivity, and establishing or dismantling connections with pyramidal neurons. Differences in LMT-C plasticity reflected properties of individual LMT-Cs, not mossy fibers. LMT-C maintenance and growth were regulated by spiking activity, mGluR2-sensitive transmitter release from LMTs, and PKC. Thus, subsets of terminal arborization complexes by mossy fibers rearrange their local connectivities in response to experience and age throughout life.},

Some believe that thalamic and cortical neurons transmitting information about the conditioned stimulus (CS) to the lateral amygdala (LA) serve a relay function. Others maintain that thalamic and/or cortical plasticity is critically involved in fear conditioning. To address this question, we developed a large-scale biophysical model of the LA that could reproduce earlier findings regarding the cellular correlates of fear conditioning in LA. We then conducted model experiments that examined whether fear memories depend on (1) training-induced increases in the responsiveness of thalamic and cortical neurons projecting to LA, (2) plasticity at the synapses they form in LA, and/or (3) plasticity at synapses between LA neurons. These tests revealed that training-induced increases in the responsiveness of afferent neurons are required for fear memory formation. However, once the memory has been formed, this factor is no longer required because the efficacy of the synapses that thalamic and cortical neurons form with LA cells has augmented enough to maintain the memory. In contrast, our model experiments suggest that plasticity at synapses between LA neurons plays a minor role in maintaining the fear memory.},

Nonpharmacological treatments are available for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although their efficacy remains uncertain. The authors undertook meta-analyses of the efficacy of dietary (restricted elimination diets, artificial food color exclusions, and free fatty acid supplementation) and psychological (cognitive training, neurofeedback, and behavioral interventions) ADHD treatments.Method Using a common systematic search and a rigorous coding and data extraction strategy across domains, the authors searched electronic databases to identify published randomized controlled trials that involved individuals who were diagnosed with ADHD (or who met a validated cutoff on a recognized rating scale) and that included an ADHD outcome.Results Fifty-four of the 2,904 nonduplicate screened records were included in the analyses. Two different analyses were performed. When the outcome measure was based on ADHD assessments by raters closest to the therapeutic setting, all dietary (standardized mean differences=0.21\textendash{}0.48) and psychological (standardized mean differences=0.40\textendash{}0.64) treatments produced statistically significant effects. However, when the best probably blinded assessment was employed, effects remained significant for free fatty acid supplementation (standardized mean difference=0.16) and artificial food color exclusion (standardized mean difference=0.42) but were substantially attenuated to nonsignificant levels for other treatments.Conclusions Free fatty acid supplementation produced small but significant reductions in ADHD symptoms even with probably blinded assessments, although the clinical significance of these effects remains to be determined. Artificial food color exclusion produced larger effects but often in individuals selected for food sensitivities. Better evidence for efficacy from blinded assessments is required for behavioral interventions, neurofeedback, cognitive training, and restricted elimination diets before they can be supported as treatments for core ADHD symptoms.Abstract Teaser},

  abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that decreased functional connectivity in cortical networks precedes clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although our knowledge about cerebral and biological correlates of this phenomenon is limited. To shed light on this issue, we have investigated whether resting-state oscillatory connectivity patterns in healthy older (HO) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subjects are related to anatomical grey matter (GM) and functional (2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-PET) changes of neuroelectric sources of alpha rhythms, and/or to changes in plasma amyloid-beta (A\ensuremath{\beta}) and serum lipid levels, blood markers tied to AD pathogenesis and aging-related cognitive decline. We found that aMCI subjects showed decreased levels of cortical connectivity, reduced FDG-PET intake of the precuneus, and GM atrophy of the thalamus, together with higher levels of A\ensuremath{\beta} and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) compared to HO. Interestingly, levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were positively correlated with the strength of neural-phase coupling in aMCI subjects, and increased triglycerides accompanied bilateral GM loss in the precuneus of aMCI subjects. Together, these findings provide peripheral blood correlates of reduced resting-state cortical connectivity in aMCI, supported by anatomo-functional changes in cerebral sources of alpha rhythms. This framework constitutes an integrated approach to assess functional changes in cortical networks through neuroimaging and peripheral blood markers during early stages of neurodegeneration.},

Here we synthesize past observations to provide strong evidence that the default network is a specific, anatomically defined brain system preferentially active when individuals are not focused on the external environment. Analysis of connectional anatomy in the monkey supports the presence of an interconnected brain system. Providing insight into function, the default network is active when individuals are engaged in internally focused tasks including autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future, and conceiving the perspectives of others. Probing the functional anatomy of the network in detail reveals that it is best understood as multiple interacting subsystems. The medial temporal lobe subsystem provides information from prior experiences in the form of memories and associations that are the building blocks of mental simulation. The medial prefrontal subsystem facilitates the flexible use of this information during the construction of self-relevant mental simulations. These two subsystems converge on important nodes of integration including the posterior cingulate cortex. The implications of these functional and anatomical observations are discussed in relation to possible adaptive roles of the default network for using past experiences to plan for the future, navigate social interactions, and maximize the utility of moments when we are not otherwise engaged by the external world.

But in addition to these synaptic changes, certain learning tasks produce enduring changes in the intrinsic excitability of neurons by changing the function of voltage-gated ion channels, a change that can produce broader, even neuron-wide changes in synaptic throughput. We will consider the evidence for persistent changes in intrinsic neuronal excitability \textemdash{} what we will call intrinsic plasticity \textemdash{} that is produced by training in behaving animals and by artificial patterns of activation in brain slices and neuronal cultures.

During this period, the activity of many inhibitory cells was suppressed, which suggests that new spatial information creates conditions in the hippocampal circuitry that are conducive to the synaptic modification presumed to be involved in learning. Development of a new population code for a novel environment did not substantially alter the code for a familiar one, which suggests that the interference between the two spatial representations was very small.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: \ensuremath{\beta}-amyloid (A\ensuremath{\beta}) accumulation is described as a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A\ensuremath{\beta} perturbs a number of synaptic components including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing \ensuremath{\alpha}7 subunits (\ensuremath{\alpha}7-nAChRs), which are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus and found on GABAergic interneurons. We have previously demonstrated the existence of a novel, heteromeric \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChR in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that exhibits high sensitivity to acute A\ensuremath{\beta} exposure. To extend our previous work, we evaluated the expression and pharmacology of \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChRs in hippocampal interneurons and their sensitivity to A\ensuremath{\beta}.
RESULTS: GABAergic interneurons in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus expressed functional \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChRs, which were characterized by relatively slow whole-cell current kinetics, pharmacological sensitivity to dihydro-\ensuremath{\beta}-erythroidine (DH\ensuremath{\beta}E), a nAChR \ensuremath{\beta}2* subunit selective blocker, and \ensuremath{\alpha}7 and \ensuremath{\beta}2 subunit interaction using immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChRs were sensitive to 1 nM oligomeric A\ensuremath{\beta}. Similar effects were observed in identified hippocampal interneurons prepared from GFP-GAD mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that A\ensuremath{\beta} modulation of cholinergic signaling in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons via \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChRs could be an early and critical event in A\ensuremath{\beta}-induced functional abnormalities of hippocampal function, which may be relevant to learning and memory deficits in AD.},

  abstract = {Recent brain imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have implicated insula and anterior cingulate cortices in the empathic response to another's pain. However, virtually nothing is known about the impact of the voluntary generation of compassion on this network. To investigate these questions we assessed brain activity using fMRI while novice and expert meditation practitioners generated a loving-kindness-compassion meditation state. To probe affective reactivity, we presented emotional and neutral sounds during the meditation and comparison periods. Our main hypothesis was that the concern for others cultivated during this form of meditation enhances affective processing, in particular in response to sounds of distress, and that this response to emotional sounds is modulated by the degree of meditation training. The presentation of the emotional sounds was associated with increased pupil diameter and activation of limbic regions (insula and cingulate cortices) during meditation (versus rest). During meditation, activation in insula was greater during presentation of negative sounds than positive or neutral sounds in expert than it was in novice meditators. The strength of activation in insula was also associated with self-reported intensity of the meditation for both groups. These results support the role of the limbic circuitry in emotion sharing. The comparison between meditation vs. rest states between experts and novices also showed increased activation in amygdala, right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in response to all sounds, suggesting, greater detection of the emotional sounds, and enhanced mentation in response to emotional human vocalizations for experts than novices during meditation. Together these data indicate that the mental expertise to cultivate positive emotion alters the activation of circuitries previously linked to empathy and theory of mind in response to emotional stimuli.},

A subconvulsive dose of 25-mg/kg PTZ was administered every 15 min, and the occurrence of clonic and tonic-clonic seizures was scored. The 10-day-old pups were quite sensitive to PTZ and showed mainly clonic seizures. The highest threshold and latency of PTZ-induced clonic and tonic-clonic convulsions were observed at PN 26 in both strains. From that age onwards, the seizure threshold significantly decreased and reached a minimum at PN 220. Between strain comparisons showed that WAG/Rij rats have a lower tonic-clonic seizure threshold than Wistar rats. The data indicate that changes in susceptibility first quickly decreases until PN 26-30 and then tend to monotonically increase with age, and that genetically prone nonconvulsive WAG/Rij rats are more vulnerable to convulsive seizures induced by PTZ than Wistar rats.},

We hypothesized that spine loss results from plaque-associated alterations of spine stability, causing an imbalance in spine formation and elimination. To investigate effects of plaques on spine stability in vivo, we observed cortical neurons using multiphoton microscopy in a mouse model of amyloid pathology before and after extensive plaque deposition. We also observed age-matched nontransgenic mice to study normal effects of aging on spine plasticity. We found that spine density and structural plasticity are maintained during normal aging. Tg2576 mice had normal spine density and plasticity before plaques appeared, but after amyloid pathology is established, severe disruptions were observed. In control animals, spine formation and elimination were equivalent over 1 hour of observation (\ensuremath{\sim}5\% of observed spines), resulting in stable spine density. However, in aged Tg2576 mice spine elimination increased, specifically in the immediate vicinity of plaques. Spine formation was unchanged, resulting in spine loss. These data show a small population of rapidly changing spines in adult and even elderly mouse cortex; further, in the vicinity of amyloid plaques, spine stability is markedly impaired leading to loss of synaptic structural integrity.},

Two critical remaining issues for the area of cognitive training in late life are: a) the persistence of effect over extended follow-up and b) transfer of effect to non-trained domains. The aim of this report was to therefore systematically review results from clinical trials which have examined the effect of cognitive exercise on longitudinal cognitive performance in healthy elderly individuals. Methods: MEDLINE, PubMed and key references were used to generate an initial list of relevant studies (N = 54). These were reviewed to identify randomized controlled trials which tested the effect of a discrete cognitive training regime on longitudinal (\ensuremath{>}3 months) post-training neuropsychological performance in healthy older adults. Seven RCTs met entry criteria. Pre- and post- change scores were integrated using a random effects weighted mean difference (WMD) meta-analytic approach (Review Manager Version 4.2). Results: A strong effect size was observed for cognitive exercise interventions compared to wait-and-see control conditions (WMD = 1.07, CI: 0.32-1.83, z = 2.78, n = 7, p = 0.006, N = 3194). RCTs with follow-up greater than 2 years did not appear to produce lower effect size estimates than those with less extended follow-up. Quality of reporting of trials was in general low. Conclusions: Systematic review of cognitive training in healthy older individuals found strong and persistent protective effects on longitudinal neuropsychological performance. Transfer of these effects to dementia-relevant domains such as general cognition and daily functioning has been reported in some studies. Importantly, cognitive training has yet to be shown to prevent incident dementia in an appropriately designed trial and this is now an international priority.},

  abstract = {Introduction. The circulation of large amounts of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated derivative (DHEA-S) suggests a physiological role in human physiology. In the central nervous system, DHEA is considered a neurosteroid with a wide range of functions.Aim. The goal of this review is to discuss metabolism, biochemical, and physiological mechanism of DHEA action and the potential role of DHEA in aging and in ameliorating a host of pathological conditions, associated with aging.Methods. We examined preclinical and clinical data reported in various studies from the available literature concerning the effects of DHEA in normal and pathological conditions.Main Outcome Measures. Data reported in the literature were analyzed, reviewed, and discussed.Results. DHEA mediates its action via multiple signaling pathways involving specific membrane receptors and via transformation into androgen and estrogen derivatives (e.g., androgens, estrogens, 7\ensuremath{\alpha} and 7\ensuremath{\beta} DHEA, and 7\ensuremath{\alpha} and 7\ensuremath{\beta} epiandrosterone derivatives) acting through their specific receptors. These pathways include: nitric oxide synthase activation, modulation of \ensuremath{\gamma}-amino butyric acid receptors, N-methyl D-aspartate, receptors sigma receptors (Sigma-1), differential expression of inflammatory factors, adhesion molecules and reactive oxygen species, among others. Clinical and epidemiological studies suggested that low DHEA levels might be associated with ischemic heart disease, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, bone loss, inflammatory diseases, and sexual dysfunction. Most importantly, no significant adverse or negative side effects of DHEA were reported in clinical studies of men and women.Conclusions. DHEA modulates endothelial function, reduces inflammation, improves insulin sensitivity, blood flow, cellular immunity, body composition, bone metabolism, sexual function, and physical strength in frailty and provides neuroprotection, improves cognitive function, and memory enhancement. DHEA possesses pleiotropic effects and reduced levels of DHEA and DHEA-S may be associated with a host of pathologies; however, the clinical efficacy of DHEA supplementation in ameliorating patho-physiological symptoms remains to be evaluated.

  abstract = {Gonadal hormones modulate fear acquisition, but less is known about the influence of gonadal hormones on fear extinction. We assessed sex differences and the influence of gonadal hormone fluctuations and exogenous manipulations of estrogen and progesterone on acquisition, extinction learning and extinction recall in a 3 day auditory fear conditioning and extinction protocol. Experiments were conducted on males and naturally cycling female rats. Regarding female rats, significant differences in fear extinction were observed between subgroups of females, depending on their phase of the estrous cycle. Extinction that took place during the proestrus (high estrogen/progesterone) phase was more fully consolidated, as evidenced by low freezing during a recall test. This suggests that estrogen and/or progesterone facilitate extinction. In support of this, injection of both estrogen and progesterone prior to extinction learning in female rats during the metestrus phase of the cycle (low estrogen/progesterone) facilitated extinction consolidation, and blockade of estrogen and progesterone receptors during the proestrus phase impaired extinction consolidation. When comparing male to female rats without consideration of the estrous cycle phase, no significant sex differences were observed. When accounting for cycle phase in females, sex differences were observed only during extinction recall. Female rats that underwent extinction during the metestrus phase showed significantly higher freezing during the recall test relative to males. Collectively, these data suggest that gonadal hormones influence extinction behavior possibly by influencing the function of brain regions involved in the consolidation of fear extinction. Moreover, the elevated fear observed in female relative to male rats during extinction recall suggests that gonadal hormones may in part play a role in the higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in women.},

  abstract = {Microglia function as the primary immune effector cells in the brain and play a pivotal role in the neuroinflammatory processes which are critical component of neurodegenerative diseases. Alcohol abuse has been considered as one of the common reasons for neurodegeneration although the causative factors are poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether activated microglia were implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunctions in adult rats after intermittent alcohol abuse. Rats were given orally a priming dose of 5 g/kg ethanol and then 3g/kg every 8h for 4 days, followed by a 3-day ethanol-withdrawal period. These 4 days of ethanol treatments were repeated four times intermittently to simulate the binge drinking of human alcoholics. Neurodegeneration and microglial activation were detected by Fluoro-Jade B staining, Golgi staining, immunohistochemistry and ELISA, respectively, while cognitive function was assessed by Morris water maze and novel object recognition. The results showed that microglial activation and inflammatory cytokine expression were obvious in the parietal association cortex, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus accompanied by neurodegeneration following ethanol treatment. Moreover, learning and memory abilities also declined following ethanol treatments. However, the hypertrophied microglia disappeared accompanied by the decrease of inflammatory cytokines levels on day 4, and ramified microglial proliferated significantly on day 14 after ethanol withdrawal, along with a recovery from neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. Thus, the present study indicated that activated microglia might be involved in neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunctions induced by intermittent ethanol exposure, and neurotrophic microglia appear to have a contribution to the recovery during abstinence.},

  abstract = {Neurons and glia in the central nervous system express the necessary enzymes for the synthesis of neurosteroids that are produced in concentrations high enough to exert paracrine effects. Synthesis of brain neurosteroids declines with age, during stressful conditions (including major depression, chronic psychological stress), and in chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent reports associate the decrease of brain neurosteroids to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. This review summarizes the recent findings on how the most studied neurosteroids (dehydroepiandrosterone, pregnenolone and their sulphate esters, progesterone and allopregnanolone) affect neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis; furthermore, this review discusses potential applications of these neurosteroids in the therapeutic management of neurodegenerative conditions, including that of age-related brain atrophy.},

  abstract = {The prefrontal cortex and the amygdala have synergistic roles in regulating purposive behavior, effected through bidirectional pathways. Here we investigated the largely unknown extent and laminar relationship of prefrontal input-output zones linked with the amygdala using neural tracers injected in the amygdala in rhesus monkeys. Prefrontal areas varied vastly in their connections with the amygdala, with the densest connections found in posterior orbitofrontal and posterior medial cortices, and the sparsest in anterior lateral prefrontal areas, especially area 10. Prefrontal projection neurons directed to the amygdala originated in layer 5, but significant numbers were also found in layers 2 and 3 in posterior medial and orbitofrontal cortices. Amygdalar axonal terminations in prefrontal cortex were most frequently distributed in bilaminar bands in the superficial and deep layers, by columns spanning the entire cortical depth, and less frequently as small patches centered in the superficial or deep layers. Heavy terminations in layers 1-2 overlapped with calbindin-positive inhibitory neurons. A comparison of the relationship of input to output projections revealed that among the most heavily connected cortices, cingulate areas 25 and 24 issued comparatively more projections to the amygdala than they received, whereas caudal orbitofrontal areas were more receivers than senders. Further, there was a significant relationship between the proportion of 'feedforward' cortical projections from layers 2-3 to 'feedback' terminations innervating the superficial layers of prefrontal cortices. These findings indicate that the connections between prefrontal cortices and the amygdala follow similar patterns as corticocortical connections, and by analogy suggest pathways underlying the sequence of information processing for emotions.},

  abstract = {Summary: Purpose: Seizures in the developing brain cause less macroscopic structural damage than do seizures in adulthood, but accumulating evidence shows that seizures early in life can be associated with persistent behavioral and cognitive impairments. We previously showed that long-term spatial memory in the eight-arm radial-arm maze was impaired in rats that experienced a single episode of kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus during early development (postnatal days (P) 1\textendash{}14). Here we extend those findings by using a set of behavioral paradigms that are sensitive to additional aspects of learning and behavior.Methods: On P1, P7, P14, or P24, rats underwent status epilepticus induced by intraperitoneal injections of age-specific doses of KA. In adulthood (P90\textendash{}P100), the behavioral performance of these rats was compared with that of control rats that did not receive KA. A modified version of the radial-arm maze was used to assess short-term spatial memory; the Morris water maze was used to evaluate long-term spatial memory and retrieval; and the elevated plus maze was used to determine anxiety.Results: Compared with controls, rats with KA seizures at each tested age had impaired short-term spatial memory in the radial-arm maze (longer latency to criterion and more reference errors), deficient long-term spatial learning and retrieval in the water maze (longer escape latencies and memory for platform location), and a greater degree of anxiety in the elevated plus maze (greater time spent in open arms).Conclusions: These findings provide additional support for the concept that seizures early in life may be followed by life-long impairment of certain cognitive and behavioral functions. These results may have clinical implications, favoring early and aggressive control of seizures during development.},

  abstract = {The insular cortex (IC) is an important forebrain structure involved in pain perception and taste memory formation. Using a 64-channel multi-electrode array system, we recently identified and characterized two major forms of synaptic plasticity in the adult mouse IC: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). In this study, we investigate injury-related metaplastic changes in insular synaptic plasticity after distal tail amputation. We found that tail amputation in adult mice produced a selective loss of low frequency stimulation-induced LTD in the IC, without affecting (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG)-evoked LTD. The impaired insular LTD could be pharmacologically rescued by priming the IC slices with a lower dose of DHPG application, a form of metaplasticity which involves activation of protein kinase C but not protein kinase A or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. These findings provide important insights into the synaptic mechanisms of cortical changes after peripheral amputation and suggest that restoration of insular LTD may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against the synaptic dysfunctions underlying the pathophysiology of phantom pain.},

  abstract = {Although plastic changes are known to occur in developing and adult cortex, it remains unclear whether these changes require remodeling of cortical circuitry whereby synapses are formed and eliminated or whether they rely on changes in the strength of existing synapses. To determine the structural stability of dendritic spines and axon terminals in vivo, we chose two approaches. First, we performed time-lapse two-photon imaging of dendritic spine motility of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in juvenile [postnatal day 28 (P28)] mice in visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices. We found that there were differences in basal rates of dendritic spine motility of the same neuron type in different cortices, with visual cortex exhibiting the least structural dynamics. Rewiring visual input into the auditory cortex at birth, however, failed to alter dendritic spine motility, suggesting that structural plasticity rates might be intrinsic to the cortical region. Second, we investigated the persistence of both the presynaptic (axon terminals) and postsynaptic (dendritic spine) structures in young adult mice (P40-P61), using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in different sensory areas. Both terminals and spines were relatively stable, with \ensuremath{>}80\% persisting over a 3 week period in all sensory regions. Axon terminals were more stable than dendritic spines. These data suggest that changes in network function during adult learning and memory might occur through changes in the strength and efficacy of existing synapses as well as some remodeling of connectivity through the loss and gain of synapses.},

  abstract = {A primary objective in developing a neural prosthesis is to replace neural circuitry in the brain that no longer functions appropriately. Such a goal requires artificial reconstruction of neuron-to-neuron connections in a way that can be recognized by the remaining normal circuitry, and that promotes appropriate interaction. In this study, the application of a specially designed neural prosthesis using a multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear model is demonstrated by using trains of electrical stimulation pulses to substitute for MIMO model derived ensemble firing patterns. Ensembles of CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons, recorded from rats performing a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) memory task, exhibited successful encoding of trial-specific sample lever information in the form of different spatiotemporal firing patterns. MIMO patterns, identified online and in real-time, were employed within a closed-loop behavioral paradigm. Results showed that the model was able to predict successful performance on the same trial. Also, MIMO model-derived patterns, delivered as electrical stimulation to the same electrodes, improved performance under normal testing conditions and, more importantly, were capable of recovering performance when delivered to animals with ensemble hippocampal activity compromised by pharmacologic blockade of synaptic transmission. These integrated experimental-modeling studies show for the first time that, with sufficient information about the neural coding of memories, a neural prosthesis capable of real-time diagnosis and manipulation of the encoding process can restore and even enhance cognitive, mnemonic processes.},

  abstract = {The effects of brief seizures during development depend on multiple factors such as underlying brain pathology, specific age of occurrence and frequency. Studies in rats are frequently used to determine the consequences of seizures in the developing brain. The shorter prepubertal development and life span of the rat compared to humans may suggest that brief seizures in the rat are not necessarily equivalent to brief seizures in humans. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that in the rat, the consequences of seizures are age-dependent. The immature brain is relatively resistant to morphological damage, especially in the hippocampus, and functional changes as measured by electrophysiology and behavior. Developmental kindling can be used as a model to study brief seizures early in life. Kindling permanently alters the brain so that rats stimulated again in adulthood require only few kindling stimuli for fully kindled seizures to occur although there are no apparent morphological and functional changes in the hippocampus resulting from kindling early in life. The appreciation that kindling can alter brain function without any discrete (to date) morphological changes may lead to the development of effective neuroprotective strategies to alter the process, but it is not clear that all kindling-induced changes are detrimental to the brain.},

We highlight recent neuroimaging research on self-regulatory failure, the findings of which support a balance model of self-regulation whereby self-regulatory failure occurs whenever the balance is tipped in favor of subcortical areas, either due to particularly strong impulses or when prefrontal function itself is impaired. Such a model is consistent with recent findings in the cognitive neuroscience of addictive behavior, emotion regulation and decision-making.},

Existing theories view its role in decision-making as restricted to an early valuation stage that provides input to decision mechanisms in downstream brain structures. However, the extent to which the amygdala itself codes information about economic choices is unclear. Here, we report that individual neurons in the primate amygdala predict behavioral choices in an economic decision task. We recorded the activity of amygdala neurons while monkeys chose between saving liquid reward with interest and spending the accumulated reward. In addition to known value-related responses, we found that activity in a group of amygdala neurons predicted the monkeys' upcoming save\textendash{}spend choices with an average accuracy of 78\%. This choice-predictive activity occurred early in trials, even before information about specific actions associated with save\textendash{}spend choices was available. For a substantial number of neurons, choice-differential activity was specific for free, internally generated economic choices and not observed in a control task involving forced imperative choices. A subgroup of choice-predictive neurons did not show relationships to value, movement direction, or visual stimulus features. Choice-predictive activity in some amygdala neurons was preceded by transient periods of value coding, suggesting value-to-choice transitions and resembling decision processes in other brain systems. These findings suggest that the amygdala might play an active role in economic decisions. Current views of amygdala function should be extended to incorporate a role in decision-making beyond valuation.},

We used a developmental seizure model in which we exposed Xenopus laevis tadpoles to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a known convulsant. We found that, after an initial PTZ exposure, seizure onset times were delayed in response to a second PTZ exposure 4 h later. This protective effect was a result of activity-dependent increases in synthesis of putrescine, the simplest polyamine. Unlike more complex polyamines that directly modulate ion channels, putrescine exerted its effect by altering the balance of excitation to inhibition. Tectal neuron recordings, 4 h after the initial seizure, revealed an elevated frequency of GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Our data suggest that this effect is mediated by an atypical pathway that converts putrescine into GABA, which then activates presynaptic GABA(B) receptors. Our data suggest that polyamines have a previously unknown neuroprotective role in the developing brain.},

To further these investigations we recorded electroencephalographical and behavioural activity in DOM and control rats following a normally sub-convulsant dose (25 mg/kg) of pentylenetetrazol. During this exposure, 50\% of DOM-treated rats experienced a Stage V (tonic-clonic) seizure (X2(1)=5.33, P=0.021), indicating a lowering of generalized seizure threshold in these animals. In a separate experiment we explored focal seizure (afterdischarge) threshold as well as seizure propagation rates in treated rats, using a 25 consecutive day standard amygdala kindling paradigm. We report that the afterdischarge threshold for DOM-treated rats was significantly lower than controls (F(1,27)=7.117, P=0.013). No difference between groups was found in seizure progression as measured by afterdischarge duration, latency to first Stage V seizure, or latency to reach a fully kindled state (defined as five consecutive Stage V seizures). Timm staining to assess mossy fibre sprouting (MFS) in the hippocampus revealed a significant MFS increase relative to sham at the ventral level in both left and right inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus for all DOM-treated animals, as well as in the dorsal stratum oriens of CA3 contralateral to electrode placement, and these increases were further enhanced by the kindling procedure. We conclude that perinatal exposure to subconvulsive doses of DOM results in permanent changes in neuronal excitability in the adult rat, as demonstrated by a lowering of both generalized seizure and focal afterdischarge threshold, and produces increased MFS following kindling.},

  abstract = {Background/Aims
This study explores the effective outcomes of a structured cognitive stimulation treatment to improve cognition and behavioral symptoms in people with dementia (PWDs), using a randomized controlled clinical trial.

Methods
Thirty PWDs were divided into three groups: experimental (treated with cognitive stimulation), placebo (treated with occupational therapy), and control (continuing with the usual activities of the nursing home). Assessment, at baseline and after a period of 8 weeks, was performed using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, activities of daily living, Mini-Mental State Examination, Esame Neuropsicologico Breve 2, Geriatric Depression Scale and Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Scale.

Results
Only the experimental group improved its performance in cognitive tests (p \ensuremath{<} 0.05) and showed a significant decrease in behavioral symptoms (p \ensuremath{<} 0.01) after the treatment.

Conclusions
The results suggest that a cognitive stimulation treatment for PWDs would improve not only their cognition, but also behavioral symptoms.},

Weight maintenance, eucaloric diets with identical macronutrient profiles and fiber content were designed. All food was weighed and distributed. Insulin action was assessed using a two-step euglycemic clamp; glycemic profiles were assessed by the continuous glucose monitoring system and vascular compliance by pulse-wave analysis. There was no change in weight across the study. Peripheral glucose uptake and suppression of endogenous glucose production were similar after each diet. Glycemic profiles and measures of vascular compliance did not change. A rise in total and LDL cholesterol was observed. In this study, a high-sucrose intake as part of an eucaloric, weight-maintaining diet had no detrimental effect on insulin sensitivity, glycemic profiles, or measures of vascular compliance in healthy nondiabetic subjects.},

  abstract = {Much attention has been paid to the associative processes that are necessary to fuse together representations of the various components of an episodic memory. In the present study, we focus on the processes involved in the formation of lasting representations of the individual components that make up a fear-conditioning episode. In one-trial contextual fear conditioning experiments, weak conditioning to context occurs if the shock is delivered immediately following placement of the animal in a novel conditioning apparatus, a phenomenon known as the immediate shock deficit. We show that the immediate shock deficit in mice may be alleviated by pre-exposure to either the context or shock. In using this approach to temporally dissect a contextual fear-conditioning task into its constituent representational and associative processes, we are able to examine directly the processes that are important for formation of lasting representations of the context conditioned stimulus (CS) or unconditioned stimulus (US). Our data indicate that the formation of a lasting representation of the context or shock engages protein synthesis-dependent processes. Furthermore, genetic disruption of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of new proteins required for long-term memory, disrupts the formation of lasting context memories. We go on to show that the stress hormone epinephrine modulates the consolidation of a context memory, and reverses consolidation deficits in the CREB-deficient mice. Finally we show that disrupting either NMDA or calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) function impairs consolidation of context memories. Together, these data suggest that this approach is particularly suited for the characterization of molecular and cellular processes underlying the formation of stimulus representations.},

  shorttitle = {Effects of cognitive training interventions with older adults},
  abstract = {CONTEXT: Cognitive function in older adults is related to independent living and need for care. However, few studies have addressed whether improving cognitive functions might have short- or long-term effects on activities related to living independently.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether 3 cognitive training interventions improve mental abilities and daily functioning in older, independent-living adults.
DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, single-blind trial with recruitment conducted from March 1998 to October 1999 and 2-year follow-up through December 2001.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 2832 persons aged 65 to 94 years recruited from senior housing, community centers, and hospital/clinics in 6 metropolitan areas in the United States.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: 10-session group training for memory (verbal episodic memory; n = 711), or reasoning (ability to solve problems that follow a serial pattern; n = 705), or speed of processing (visual search and identification; n = 712); or a no-contact control group (n = 704). For the 3 treatment groups, 4-session booster training was offered to a 60\% random sample 11 months later.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive function and cognitively demanding everyday functioning.
RESULTS: Thirty participants were incorrectly randomized and were excluded from the analysis. Each intervention improved the targeted cognitive ability compared with baseline, durable to 2 years (P\ensuremath{<}.001 for all). Eighty-seven percent of speed-, 74\% of reasoning-, and 26\% of memory-trained participants demonstrated reliable cognitive improvement immediately after the intervention period. Booster training enhanced training gains in speed (P\ensuremath{<}.001) and reasoning (P\ensuremath{<}.001) interventions (speed booster, 92\%; no booster, 68\%; reasoning booster, 72\%; no booster, 49\%), which were maintained at 2-year follow-up (P\ensuremath{<}.001 for both). No training effects on everyday functioning were detected at 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Results support the effectiveness and durability of the cognitive training interventions in improving targeted cognitive abilities. Training effects were of a magnitude equivalent to the amount of decline expected in elderly persons without dementia over 7- to 14-year intervals. Because of minimal functional decline across all groups, longer follow-up is likely required to observe training effects on everyday function.},

  abstract = {This study examined the effects of neurosteroids dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and pregnenolone sulfate (PS) and progesterone on the Porsolt forced swim test of depression in mice, and investigated the possible involvement of delta receptors. The immobility time in the mouse forced swimming test was significantly reduced by DHEAS (5 and 20 mg/kg, s.c.) and PS (5 mg/kg) without accompanying changes in the ambulatory or open-field activity. Pretreatment with DHEAS (10 mg/kg) or PS (10 and 20 mg/kg), however, failed to modify the immobility. The relief of behavioral despair in the immobility test by DHEAS (5 and 20 mg/kg) was dose-dependently blocked by preadministration of NE-100 (N,N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy)phenyl-ethylamine monohydrochloride; 0.5 and 1 mg/kg), a putative delta1 receptor antagonist, or progesterone (10 mg/kg), a delta receptor antagonistic neurosteroid. On the other hand, PS (5 mg/kg)-induced decrease in the immobility was significantly blocked by NE-100(0.5 mg/kg), but not by progesterone (10 mg/kg). Neither NE-100 nor progesterone influenced the immobility alone. These data suggest a role for central delta receptor in the antidepressant-like effects of neurosteroids, and reinforced their potential therapeutic use in depression.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have compared episodic and spatial memory in neuroimaging paradigms in order to understand better the contribution of the hippocampus to each of these tasks. In the present study, we build on previous findings showing common neural activation in default network areas during episodic and spatial memory tasks based on familiar, real-world environments (Hirshhorn et al. (2012) Neuropsychologia 50:3094-3106). Following previous demonstrations of the presence of functionally connected sub-networks within the default network, we performed seed-based functional connectivity analyses to determine how, depending on the task, the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex differentially couple with one another and with distinct whole-brain networks. We found evidence for a medial prefrontal-parietal network and a medial temporal lobe network, which were functionally connected to the prefrontal and hippocampal seeds, respectively, regardless of the nature of the memory task. However, these two networks were functionally connected with one another during the episodic memory task, but not during spatial memory tasks. Replicating previous reports of fractionation of the default network into stable sub-networks, this study also shows how these sub-networks may flexibly couple and uncouple with one another based on task demands. These findings support the hypothesis that episodic memory and spatial memory share a common medial temporal lobe-based neural substrate, with episodic memory recruiting additional prefrontal sub-networks. \textcopyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Indeed, when the ratio of intrinsically excitable cells was increased or decreased, the number of plastic cells remained relatively constant. Analysis of the connectivity of plastic and nonplastic cells revealed that subsets of principal LA neurons effectively band together by virtue of their excitatory interconnections to suppress plasticity in other principal cells via the recruitment of inhibitory interneurons.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data from the human motor cortex suggest that, depending on polarity, direct current (DC) brain polarization can depress or activate cortical neurons. Activating effects on the frontal lobe might be beneficial for patients with frontal lobe disorders. This phase 1 study tested the safety of frontal DC, including its effects on frontal and other brain functions.
METHODS: The authors applied 20 minutes of anodal, cathodal, or sham DC to the left prefrontal cortex in three groups of right-handed subjects and looked for effects on global measures of processing and psychomotor speed, emotion, and verbal fluency, a measure of local cortical function. In one experiment (n = 30), the authors tested before and after 1 mA DC and monitored EEG in 9 subjects. In two other experiments using 1 mA (n = 43) and 2 mA (n = 30), the authors tested before and then starting 5 minutes after the onset of DC.
RESULTS: All subjects tolerated DC well. There were no significant effects on performance with 1 mA DC. At 2 mA, verbal fluency improved significantly with anodal and decreased mildly with cathodal DC. There were no clinically significant effects on the other measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited exposure to direct current polarization of the prefrontal cortex is safe and can enhance verbal fluency selectively in healthy subjects. As such, it deserves consideration as a procedure to improve frontal lobe function in patients.},

There is little direct evidence, however, that links early seizures with the later development of epilepsy and selective hippocampal neuronal loss.
Objective: To study the long-term effect of early seizures on later seizure-induced neuronal damage and behavior.
Methods: We used a ``two hit'' rat seizure mode in which systemic kainate was used to induce seizures during the second week of life (P15) and again in adulthood (P45). Memory was subsequently tested using a Morris water maze, and brains were examined for histologic evidence of injury.
Results: Although the first kainate-induced seizure is not associated with detectable injury or cell death, it predisposes animals to more extensive neuronal injury after kainate-induced seizures in adulthood. Moreover, although early-life kainate-induced seizures cause no impairment of spatial learning, animals that have early-life and adult kainate-induced seizures perform significantly worse than those that have seizures only as adults.
Conclusions: We concluded that early-life seizures, without causing overt cellular injury, predispose the brain to the damaging effect of seizures later in life.},

Here we use chronic multielectrode recordings to monitor firing rates in visual cortex of freely behaving rats during chronic monocular visual deprivation (MD). Firing rates in V1 were suppressed over the first 2 day of MD but then rebounded to baseline over the next 2\textendash{}3 days despite continued MD. This drop and rebound in firing was accompanied by bidirectional changes in mEPSC amplitude measured ex vivo. The rebound in firing was independent of sleep-wake state but was cell type specific, as putative FS and regular spiking neurons responded to MD with different time courses. These data establish that homeostatic mechanisms within the intact CNS act to stabilize neuronal firing rates in the face of sustained sensory perturbations.},

  abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is fundamental to the neural processes underlying learning and memory. Interestingly, synaptic plasticity itself can be dynamically regulated by prior activity, in a process termed `metaplasticity', which can be expressed both homosynaptically and heterosynaptically. Here, we focus on heterosynaptic metaplasticity, particularly long-range interactions between synapses spread across dendritic compartments, and review evidence for intracellular versus intercellular signalling pathways leading to this effect. Of particular interest is our previously reported finding that priming stimulation in stratum oriens of area CA1 in the hippocampal slice heterosynaptically inhibits subsequent long-term potentiation and facilitates long-term depression in stratum radiatum. As we have excluded the most likely intracellular signalling pathways that might mediate this long-range heterosynaptic effect, we consider the hypothesis that intercellular communication may be critically involved. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that extracellular ATP hydrolysis, and activation of adenosine A2 receptors are required to induce the metaplastic state. Moreover, delivery of the priming stimulation in stratum oriens elicited astrocytic calcium responses in stratum radiatum. Both the astrocytic responses and the metaplasticity were blocked by gap junction inhibitors. Taken together, these findings support a novel intercellular communication system, possibly involving astrocytes, being required for this type of heterosynaptic metaplasticity.},

We show that as new granule cells mature, they are increasingly likely to be incorporated into circuits supporting spatial memory. By the time the cells are 4 or more weeks of age, they are more likely than existing granule cells to be recruited into circuits supporting spatial memory. This preferential recruitment supports the idea that new neurons make a unique contribution to memory processing in the dentate gyrus.},

Past studies have suggested a role for the habenula in voluntary exercise motivation and reinforcement of intracranial self-stimulation but have not assigned these effects to specific habenula subnuclei. Here, we have developed a genetic model in which neurons of the dorsal medial habenula (dMHb) are developmentally eliminated, via tissue-specific deletion of the transcription factor Pou4f1 (Brn3a). Mice with dMHb lesions perform poorly in motivation-based locomotor behaviors, such as voluntary wheel running and the accelerating rotarod, but show only minor abnormalities in gait and balance and exhibit normal levels of basal locomotion. These mice also show deficits in sucrose preference, but not in the forced swim test, two measures of depression-related phenotypes in rodents. We have also used Cre recombinase-mediated expression of channelrhodopsin-2 and halorhodopsin to activate dMHb neurons or silence their output in freely moving mice, respectively. Optical activation of the dMHb in vivo supports intracranial self-stimulation, showing that dMHb activity is intrinsically reinforcing, whereas optical silencing of dMHb outputs is aversive. Together, our findings demonstrate that the dMHb is involved in exercise motivation and the regulation of hedonic state, and is part of an intrinsic reinforcement circuit.},

Additional strong outputs from the RMTg to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus pars dissipata, dorsal raphe nucleus, and the pontomedullary gigantocellular reticular formation were identified by anterograde tracing. RMTg neurons projecting to the ventral tegmental area express the immediate early gene Fos upon psychostimulant administration. The present study was undertaken to determine if neurons in the RMTg that project to the additional structures listed above also express Fos upon psychostimulant administration and, if so, whether single neurons in the RMTg project to more than one of these structures. We found that about 50\% of RMTg neurons exhibiting retrograde labeling after injections of retrograde tracer in the dorsal raphe or pars dissipata of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus express Fos after acute methamphetamine exposure. Also, we observed that a significant number of RMTg neurons project both to the ventral tegmental area and one of these structures. In contrast, methamphetamine-elicited Fos expression was not observed in RMTg neurons labeled with retrograde tracer following injections into the pontomedullary reticular formation. The findings suggest that the RMTg is an integrative modulator of multiple rostrally projecting structures.},

  abstract = {Scientific studies addressing anatomical variations in meditators' brains have emerged rapidly over the last few years, where significant links are most frequently reported with respect to gray matter (GM). To advance prior work, this study examined GM characteristics in a large sample of 100 subjects (50 meditators, 50 controls), where meditators have been practicing close to 20 years, on average. A standard, whole-brain voxel-based morphometry approach was applied and revealed significant meditation effects in the vicinity of the hippocampus, showing more GM in meditators than in controls as well as positive correlations with the number of years practiced. However, the hippocampal complex is regionally segregated by architecture, connectivity, and functional relevance. Thus, to establish differential effects within the hippocampal formation (cornu ammonis, fascia dentata, entorhinal cortex, subiculum) as well as the hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area, we utilized refined cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps of (peri-) hippocampal subsections. Significant meditation effects were observed within the subiculum specifically. Since the subiculum is known to play a key role in stress regulation and meditation is an established form of stress reduction, these GM findings may reflect neuronal preservation in long-term meditators-perhaps due to an attenuated release of stress hormones and decreased neurotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Arginine vasopressin and its V1a receptor subtype (V1aR) are critical for pair bond formation between adult prairie voles. However, it is unclear which brain circuits are involved in this vasopressin-mediated facilitation of pair bond formation. Here, we examined mating-induced Fos expression in several brain regions involved in sociosexual and reward circuitry in male prairie voles. Consistent with studies in other species, Fos expression was induced in several regions known to be involved in sociosexual behavior, namely, the medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and medial preoptic area. Fos induction also occurred in limbic and reward regions, including the ventral pallidum, nucleus accumbens, and mediodorsal thalamus (MDthal). Next, we infused a selective V1aR antagonist into three candidate brain regions that seemed most likely involved in vasopressin-mediated pair bond formation: the ventral pallidum, medial amygdala, and MDthal. Blockade of V1aR in the ventral pallidum, but not in the medial amygdala or MDthal, prevented partner preference formation. Lastly, we demonstrated that the mating-induced Fos activation in the ventral pallidum was vasopressin-dependent, since over-expression of V1aR using viral vector gene transfer resulted in a proportionate increase in mating-induced Fos in the same region. This is the first study to show that vasopressin neurotransmission occurs in the ventral pallidum during mating, and that V1aR activation in this region is necessary for pair bond formation in male prairie voles. The results from this study have profound implications for the neural circuitry underlying social attachment and generate novel hypotheses regarding the neural control of social behavior.},

Recent progresses in imaging techniques provided us with a unique opportunity to image neuronal activity in the brain of an intact fish in real-time while the fish perceives a natural prey, paramecium. By expanding this approach, it would be possible to image entire brain areas at a single-cell resolution in real-time during prey capture, and identify neuronal circuits important for cognitive functions. Further, activation or inhibition of those neuronal circuits with recently developed optogenetic tools or neurotoxins should shed light on their roles. Thus, we will be able to explore the prey capture in zebrafish larvae more thoroughly at cellular levels, which should establish a basis of understanding of the cognitive function in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {Diverse brain insults, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, infections, tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and prolonged acute symptomatic seizures, such as complex febrile seizures or status epilepticus (SE), can induce ``epileptogenesis,'' a process by which normal brain tissue is transformed into tissue capable of generating spontaneous recurrent seizures. Furthermore, epileptogenesis operates in cryptogenic causes of epilepsy. In view of the accumulating information about cellular and molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis, it should be possible to intervene in this process before the onset of seizures and thereby either prevent the development of epilepsy in patients at risk or increase the potential for better long-term outcome, which constitutes a major clinical need. For identifying pharmacological interventions that prevent, interrupt or reverse the epileptogenic process in people at risk, two groups of animal models, kindling and SE-induced recurrent seizures, have been recommended as potentially useful tools. Furthermore, genetic rodent models of epileptogenesis are increasingly used in assessing antiepileptogenic treatments. Two approaches have been used in these different model categories: screening of clinically established antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying potential, and targeting the key causal mechanisms that underlie epileptogenesis. The first approach indicated that among various AEDs, topiramate, levetiracetam, carisbamate, and valproate may be the most promising. On the basis of these experimental findings, two ongoing clinical trials will address the antiepileptogenic potential of topiramate and levetiracetam in patients with traumatic brain injury, hopefully translating laboratory discoveries into successful therapies. The second approach has highlighted neurodegeneration, inflammation and up-regulation of immune responses, and neuronal hyperexcitability as potential targets for antiepileptogenesis or disease modification. This article reviews these areas of progress and discusses the challenges associated with discovery of antiepileptogenic therapies.},

However, there is uncertainty regarding the nature of CeM control over conditioned fear. The present study aimed to clarify this question using unit recordings in rats. Fear conditioning caused most CeM neurons to increase their conditioned stimulus (CS) responsiveness. The next day, CeM cells responded similarly during the recall test, but these responses disappeared as extinction of conditioned fear progressed. In contrast, the CS elicited no significant average change in central lateral (CeL) firing rates during fear conditioning and a small but significant reduction during the recall test. Yet, cell-by-cell analyses disclosed large but heterogeneous CS-evoked responses in CeL. By the end of fear conditioning, roughly equal proportions of CeL cells exhibited excitatory (CeL+) or inhibitory (CeL-) CS-evoked responses (\ensuremath{\sim}10\%). The next day, the proportion of CeL- cells tripled with no change in the incidence of CeL+ cells, suggesting that conditioning leads to overnight synaptic plasticity in an inhibitory input to CeL- cells. As in CeM, extinction training caused the disappearance of CS-evoked activity in CeL. Overall, these findings suggest that conditioned freezing depends on increased CeM responses to the CS. The large increase in the incidence of CeL- but not CeL+ cells from conditioning to recall leads us to propose a model of fear conditioning involving the potentiation of an extrinsic inhibitory input (from the amygdala or elsewhere) to CeL, ultimately leading to disinhibition of CeM neurons.},

The latter studies also reveal the tVTA/RMTg as a substrate for morphine and cannabinoid action on dopamine cells. In primates, the tVTA/RMTg has been implicated in reward prediction error signals, through a basal ganglia-lateral habenula-tVTA/RMTg-dopamine-basal ganglia circuit. In rodents, the tVTA/RMTg has been shown to play a critical role in aversive behaviors, particularly those involving behavioral inhibition, such as freezing and avoidance.

  abstract = {The concept of self-regulation is central to the understanding of human development. Self-regulation allows effective socialization and predicts both psychological pathologies and levels of achievement in schools. What has been missing are neural mechanisms to provide understanding of the cellular and molecular basis for self-regulation. We show that self-regulation can be measured during childhood by parental reports and by self-reports of adolescents and adults. These reports are summarized by a higher order factor called effortful control, which reflects perceptions about the ability of a given person to regulate their behavior in accord with cultural norms. Throughout childhood effortful control is related to children's performance in computerized conflict related tasks. Conflict tasks have been shown in neuroimaging studies to activate specific brain networks of executive attention. Several brain areas work together at rest and during cognitive tasks to regulate competing brain activity and thus control resulting behavior. The cellular structure of the anterior cingulate and insula contain cells, unique to humans and higher primates that provide strong links to remote brain areas. During conflict tasks, anterior cingulate activity is correlated with activity in remote sensory and emotional systems, depending upon the information selected for the task. During adolescence the structure and activity of the anterior cingulate has been found to be correlated with self-reports of effortful control.

Studies have provided a perspective on how genes and environment act to shape the executive attention network, providing a physical basis for self-regulation. The anterior cingulate is regulated by dopamine. Genes that influence dopamine levels in the CNS have been shown to influence the efficiency of self-regulation. For example, alleles of the COMT gene that influence the efficiency of dopamine transmission are related to the ability to resolve conflict. Humans with disorders involving deletion of this gene exhibit large deficits in self-regulation. Alleles of other genes influencing dopamine and serotonin transmission have also been found to influence ability to resolve conflict in cognitive tasks. However, as is the case for many genes, the effectiveness of COMT alleles in shaping self-regulation depends upon cultural influences such as parenting. Studies find that aspects of parenting quality and parent training can influence child behavior and the efficiency of self-regulation.

During development, the network that relates to self-regulation undergoes important changes in connectivity. Infants can use parts of the self-regulatory network to detect errors in sensory information, but the network does not yet have sufficient connectivity to organize brain activity in a coherent way. During middle childhood, along with increased projection cells involved in remote connections of dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal and parietal cortex, executive network connectivity increases and shifts from predominantly short to longer range connections. During this period specific exercises can influence network development and improve self-regulation. Understanding the physical basis of self-regulation has already cast light on individual differences in normal and pathological states and gives promise of allowing the design of methods to improve aspects of human development.},

A widely accepted model posits that LTP requires the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the AMPA (\ensuremath{\alpha}-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GluA1. To find the minimum necessary requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP in mouse CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we used a single-cell molecular replacement strategy to replace all endogenous AMPA receptors with transfected subunits. In contrast to the prevailing model, we found no requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP. In fact, replacement with the GluA2 subunit showed normal LTP, as did an artificially expressed kainate receptor not normally found at these synapses. The only conditions under which LTP was impaired were those with markedly decreased AMPA receptor surface expression, indicating a requirement for a reserve pool of receptors. These results demonstrate the synapse's remarkable flexibility to potentiate with a variety of glutamate receptor subtypes, requiring a fundamental change in our thinking with regard to the core molecular events underlying synaptic plasticity.},

Setting: Ommoord, a suburb of Rotterdam.
Subjects: 7528 participants of the Rotterdam study aged 55-106 years.
Results: 474 cases of dementia were detected, giving an overall prevalence of 6.3\%. Prevalence ranged from 0.4\% (5/1181 subjects) at age 55-59 years to 43.2\% (19/44) at 95 years and over. Alzheimer's disease was the main subdiagnosis (339 cases; 72\%); it was also the main cause of the pronounced increase in dementia with age. The relative proportion of vascular dementia (76 cases; 16\%), Parkinson's disease dementia (30; 6\%), and other dementias (24; 5\%) decreased with age. A substantially higher prevalence of dementia was found in subjects with a low level of education. The association with education was not due to confounding by cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions: The prevalence of dementia increases exponentially with age. About one third of the population aged 85 and over has dementia. Three quarters of all dementia is due to Alzheimer's disease. In this study an inverse dose-response relation was found between education and dementia\textemdash{}in particular, Alzheimer's disease.

We have recently described a novel form of heterosynaptic metaplasticity in hippocampal CA1, whereby `priming' activity at one set of synapses confers a metaplastic state that inhibits subsequent LTP both within and between dendritic compartments. Here, we investigated the roles of purinergic signalling and gap junctions in mediating this long-distance communication between synapses. We found that the heterosynaptic metaplasticity requires the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP to adenosine, and activation of adenosine A2, but not A1 receptors. The metaplasticity was also blocked by the non-selective gap junction blockers carbenoxolone and meclofenamic acid, and by a connexin43-specific mimetic peptide. These results indicate that an intercellular signalling cascade underlies the long-distance communication required for this form of metaplasticity.},

In both age groups, reliable positive transfer was found not only for individual tests but also for cognitive abilities, represented as latent factors.

This process is commonly studied in rodents using context fear conditioning. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that context memories do not always undergo systems consolidation. To explain this fact, the current review describes a number of factors that determine whether or not context fear can be retrieved without the hippocampus during remote memory tests. These include neurogenesis, the presentation of reminder cues after learning, the quality of the memory that is retrieved during testing and the method that is used to inactivate the hippocampus. Based on these data, we propose that remote context fear memories can be retrieved by either the hippocampus or the neocortex. Tests of memory quality (e.g. context discrimination) can typically be used to determine which system is engaged during retrieval. The same is not true of recently formed context fear memories, which appear to always require the hippocampus during retrieval.},

We investigated this selectivity using cell type\textendash{}specific imaging and inactivation in hippocampal area CA1 of behaving mice. Aversive stimuli activated CA1 dendrite-targeting interneurons via cholinergic input, leading to inhibition of pyramidal cell distal dendrites receiving aversive sensory excitation from the entorhinal cortex. Inactivating dendrite-targeting interneurons during aversive stimuli increased CA1 pyramidal cell population responses and prevented fear learning. We propose subcortical activation of dendritic inhibition as a mechanism for exclusion of aversive stimuli from hippocampal contextual representations during fear learning.
Fear, Memory, and Place
Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is widely used as a hippocampal-dependent classical conditioning task to model human episodic memory. Lovett-Barron et al. (p. 857) combined in vivo imaging with pharmacology, pharmacogenetics, and optogenetics and they found that somatostatin-expressing, dendrite-targeting \ensuremath{\gamma}-aminobutyric acid\textendash{}releasing interneurons in hippocampal area CA1 are required for CFC. During CFC, sensory features of the aversive event reach hippocampal output neurons through excitatory cortical afferents and require active inhibitory filtering to ensure that the hippocampus exclusively encodes the conditioned stimulus.},

Little is known about the physiological properties of BLA interneurons, which can be divided into four subtypes based on their immunocytochemical profiles. Cholecystokinin (CCK) interneurons play critical roles in feedforward inhibition and behavioral fear responses. Evidence suggests that interneurons within a subgroup can display heterogeneous physiological properties. However, little is known about the physiological properties of CCK interneurons in the BLA and/or whether they represent a homogeneous or heterogeneous population. To address this question, we generated a lentivirus-expressing GFP under the control of the CCK promoter to identify CCK neurons in vivo. We combined this with whole cell patch-clamp recording techniques to examine the physiological properties of CCK-containing interneurons of the rat BLA. Here, we describe the physiological properties of 57 cells recorded in current-clamp mode; we used hierarchical cluster and discriminant function analysis to demonstrate that CCK interneurons can be segregated into three distinct subtypes (I, II, III) based on their passive and active membrane properties. Additionally, Type II neurons could be further separated into adapting and nonadapting types based on their rates of spike frequency adaptation. These data suggest that CCK interneurons of the BLA are a heterogeneous population and may be functionally distinct subpopulations that differentially contribute to the processing of emotionally salient stimuli.},

Here we explored the ability of a multitude of linear and non-linear classification algorithms to discriminate between the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of patients with varying degree of AD and their age-matched control subjects. Absolute and relative spectral power, distribution of spectral power, and measures of spatial synchronization were calculated from recordings of resting eyes-closed continuous EEGs of 45 healthy controls, 116 patients with mild AD and 81 patients with moderate AD, recruited in two different centers (Stockholm, New York). The applied classification algorithms were: principal component linear discriminant analysis (PC LDA), partial least squares LDA (PLS LDA), principal component logistic regression (PC LR), partial least squares logistic regression (PLS LR), bagging, random forest, support vector machines (SVM) and feed-forward neural network. Based on 10-fold cross-validation runs it could be demonstrated that even tough modern computer-intensive classification algorithms such as random forests, SVM and neural networks show a slight superiority, more classical classification algorithms performed nearly equally well. Using random forests classification a considerable sensitivity of up to 85\% and a specificity of 78\%, respectively for the test of even only mild AD patients has been reached, whereas for the comparison of moderate AD vs. controls, using SVM and neural networks, values of 89\% and 88\% for sensitivity and specificity were achieved. Such a remarkable performance proves the value of these classification algorithms for clinical diagnostics.},

This study explores the effective outcomes of a structured cognitive stimulation treatment to improve cognition and behavioral symptoms in people with dementia (PWDs), using a randomized controlled clinical trial.

Methods
Thirty PWDs were divided into three groups: experimental (treated with cognitive stimulation), placebo (treated with occupational therapy), and control (continuing with the usual activities of the nursing home). Assessment, at baseline and after a period of 8 weeks, was performed using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, activities of daily living, Mini-Mental State Examination, Esame Neuropsicologico Breve 2, Geriatric Depression Scale and Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Scale.

Results
Only the experimental group improved its performance in cognitive tests (p \ensuremath{<} 0.05) and showed a significant decrease in behavioral symptoms (p \ensuremath{<} 0.01) after the treatment.

Conclusions
The results suggest that a cognitive stimulation treatment for PWDs would improve not only their cognition, but also behavioral symptoms.},

Although consolidation and reconsolidation may be mediated by distinct molecular mechanisms (Lee et al., 2004), disrupting the function of the transcription factor CREB impairs both processes (Kida et al., 2002; Mamiya et al., 2009). Phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 recruits CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300 coactivators to activate transcription (Chrivia et al., 1993; Parker et al., 1996). In addition to this well known mechanism, CREB regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs), previously called transducers of regulated CREB (TORC) activity, stimulate CREB-mediated transcription, even in the absence of CREB phosphorylation. Recently, CRTC1 has been shown to undergo activity-dependent trafficking from synapses and dendrites to the nucleus in excitatory hippocampal neurons (Ch'ng et al., 2012). Despite being a powerful and specific coactivator of CREB, the role of CRTC in memory is virtually unexplored. To examine the effects of increasing CRTC levels, we used viral vectors to locally and acutely increase CRTC1 in the dorsal hippocampus dentate gyrus region of mice before training or memory reactivation in context fear conditioning. Overexpressing CRTC1 enhanced both memory consolidation and reconsolidation; CRTC1-mediated memory facilitation was context specific (did not generalize to nontrained context) and long lasting (observed after virally expressed CRTC1 dissipated). CREB overexpression produced strikingly similar effects. Therefore, increasing CRTC1 or CREB function is sufficient to enhance the strength of new, as well as established reactivated, memories without compromising memory quality.},

While allocentric working memory can be disrupted by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) blockage, the possible effects of NMDA receptor manipulation on the egocentric strategy have not been studied. Because dendritic spine plasticity in part underlies working memory-related behavioral efficiency, egocentric working memory performance was evaluated in adult rats following NMDA receptor blockade with 10 mg/kg of the NMDA-receptor antagonist CPP, i.p. Dendritic spine density and the proportion of different spine types (thin, stubby, mushroom, wide, branched and double) were assessed in third-layer pyramidal neurons of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, after behavioral testing. Working memory was evaluated by challenging the rats to resolve twelve trials per day in a single-day session over five consecutive days, in a ``cross-arm'' maze and according to a delayed match-to-sample procedure. In control animals, the dendritic spine density remained unchanged after behavioral testing, although the proportion of mushroom spines decreased while that of the branched spines increased. NMDA receptor blockade impaired the behavioral performance of rats and resulted in a decrease in dendritic spine density when compared to the control animals, and dendritic spine types were unchanged. These results suggest that behavioral efficiency of egocentric working memory is dependent on NMDA receptor activation, and that plastic changes in spine cytoarchitecture may play a key role in behavioral performance.},

Tectal neurons containing Ca2+-AMPARs form a gradient along the rostro-caudal developmental axis. These neurons had inwardly rectifying AMPAR-mediated EPSCs. Four hours of visual stimulation or addition of intracellular spermine increased rectification in immature neurons. Polyamine synthesis inhibitors blocked the effect of visual stimulation, suggesting that visual activity regulates AMPARs via the polyamine synthesis pathway. This modulation resulted in changes in the integrative properties of tectal neurons. Regulation of polyamine synthesis by physiological stimuli is a novel form of modulation of synaptic transmission important for understanding the short-term effects of enhanced sensory experience during development.},

Bilateral cortical surface electrodes and, in some animals, hippocampal depth electrodes were placed and serial video EEG was recorded for 2 h during the week following tetanus toxin injection. Tetanus toxin-induced interictal spike frequency was significantly higher and seizure duration was significantly longer in immature compared to adult rats. Immature rats tended to have more frequent seizures compared with adults, but the difference was not statistically significant. Ictal behaviors were different for the two groups with immature rats commonly demonstrating wild running seizures which were not seen in adult rats. These findings suggest that there are age-dependent differences in electrographic and behavioral seizure expression in the tetanus toxin seizure model and that the epileptic syndrome in immature rats is more severe.},

  volume = {115},
  issn = {0306-4522},
  abstract = {The striatum is a key structure of basal ganglia controlling extrapyramidal motor activity and processing addictive plasticity of abused substances. Glutamatergic transmission that is enriched in the striatum regulates a variety of striatal neuronal activities via selective activation of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). In this study, the interaction between N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5 subtypes) in activating a phosphorylation cascade to a transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) was investigated in primary cultures of E18 or postnatal day 1 striatal neurons. We found that activation of NMDA receptors with NMDA rapidly and concentration-dependently increased the number of neurons expressing phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) as revealed by immunocytochemistry. The increased pCREB expression by NMDA was sensitive to an NMDA antagonist MK801. Co-incubation of a subthreshold dose of a group I mGluR agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) that itself did not alter basal pCREB expression augmented NMDA-induced CREB phosphorylation. The mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride blocked the DHPG augmentation of NMDA-induced CREB phosphorylation, while the mGluR1 antagonist 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester did not. Interestingly, the protein kinase C inhibitors chelerythrine and G{\"o}6983 also prevented DHPG from enhancing CREB phosphorylation induced by NMDA. Whereas a low dose of the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate mimicked the DHPG potentiation. These results indicate a facilitatory regulation of an NMDA cascade to CREB phosphorylation by concurrent glutamatergic tone on mGluR5, which is probably processed via an intracellular signaling pathway involving protein kinase C.},

Using a c-fos-based transgenic mouse, we found that contextual fear extinction silenced basal amygdala (BA) excitatory neurons that had been previously activated during fear conditioning. We hypothesized that the silencing of BA fear neurons was caused by an action of extinction on BA inhibitory synapses. In support of this hypothesis, we found extinction-induced target-specific remodeling of BA perisomatic inhibitory synapses originating from parvalbumin and cholecystokinin-positive interneurons. Interestingly, the predicted changes in the balance of perisomatic inhibition matched the silent and active states of the target BA fear neurons. These observations suggest that target-specific changes in perisomatic inhibitory synapses represent a mechanism through which experience can sculpt the activation patterns within a neural circuit.},

To study the relationship between board game playing and risk of subsequent dementia in the Paquid cohort.

Design
A prospective population-based study.

Setting
In the Bordeaux area in South Western France.

Participants
3675 non-demented participants at baseline.

Primary outcome measure
The risk of dementia during the 20\hspace{0.25em}years of follow-up.

Results
Among 3675 non-demented participants at baseline, 32.2\% reported regular board game playing. Eight-hundred and forty participants developed dementia during the 20\hspace{0.25em}years of follow-up. The risk of dementia was 15\% lower in board game players than in non-players (HR=0.85, 95\% CI 0.74 to 0.99; p=0.04) after adjustment on age, gender, education and other confounders. The statistical significance disappeared after supplementary adjustment on baseline mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and depression (HR=0.96, 95\% CI 0.82 to 1.12; p=0.61). However, board game players had less decline in their MMSE score during the follow-up of the cohort (\ensuremath{\beta}=0.011, p=0.03) and less incident depression than non-players (HR=0.84; 95\% CI 0.72 to 0.98; p\ensuremath{<}0.03).

Conclusions
A possible beneficial effect of board game playing on the risk of dementia could be mediated by less cognitive decline and less depression in elderly board game players.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence suggests that soluble oligomers of amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} (oA\ensuremath{\beta}) represent the pertinent synaptotoxic form of A\ensuremath{\beta} in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanistic links between oA\ensuremath{\beta} and synaptic degeneration remain elusive. Most in vivo experiments to date have been limited to examining the toxicity of oA\ensuremath{\beta} in mouse models that also possess insoluble fibrillar A\ensuremath{\beta} (fA\ensuremath{\beta}), and data generated from these models can lead to ambiguous interpretations. Our goal in the present study was to examine the effects of soluble oA\ensuremath{\beta} on neuronal and synaptic structure in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) E693Q ("Dutch") mouse model of AD, which develops intraneuronal accumulation of soluble oA\ensuremath{\beta} with no detectable plaques in AD-relevant brain regions. We performed quantitative analyses of neuronal pathology, including dendrite morphology, spine density, and synapse ultrastructure in individual hippocampal CA1 neurons.
RESULTS: When assessing neuronal morphology and complexity we observed significant alterations in apical but not in basal dendritic arbor length in Dutch mice compared to wild type. Moreover, Dutch mice exhibited a significant decrease in dendritic arborization with a decrease in dendritic length and number of intersections at 120 \ensuremath{\mu}m and 150 \ensuremath{\mu}m from the soma, respectively. We next examined synaptic parameters and found that while there were no differences in overall synaptic structure, Dutch mice displayed a significant reduction in the post-synaptic density (PSD) length of synapses on mushroom spines, in comparison to wild type littermates.
CONCLUSION: The structural alterations to individual neurons in Dutch mice along with the changes in larger dendritic spines support the A\ensuremath{\beta} oligomer hypothesis, which postulates that the early cognitive impairments that occur in AD are attributed to the accumulation of soluble oA\ensuremath{\beta} first affecting at the synaptic level with subsequent structural disturbances and cellular degeneration.},

Reconsolidation is a nearly universal phenomenon, occurring in a diverse array of species and learning tasks. The function of reconsolidation remains unclear but it has been proposed as a mechanism for updating or strengthening memories. Observations of an analog of reconsolidation in vitro and in sensory systems indicate that reconsolidation is unlikely to be a learning-specific phenomenon and may serve a broader function. We propose that reconsolidation arises from the activity-dependent induction of two coincident but opposing processes: the depotentiation and repotentiation of strengthened synapses.

  abstract = {The study of memory in most behavioral paradigms, including emotional memory paradigms, has focused on the feed forward components that underlie Hebb's first postulate, associative synaptic plasticity. Hebb's second postulate argues that activated ensembles of neurons reverberate in order to provide temporal coordination of different neural signals, and thereby facilitate coincidence detection. Recent evidence from our groups has suggested that the lateral amygdala (LA) contains recurrent microcircuits and that these may reverberate. Additionally this reverberant activity is precisely timed with latencies that would facilitate coincidence detection between cortical and sub cortical afferents to the LA. Thus, recent data at the microcircuit level in the amygdala provide some physiological evidence in support of the second Hebbian postulate.},

Since its discovery in 1969, this kindling phenomenon has been widely studied both as a model of epileptogenesis and as a form of neuroplasticity, and recently there has been increasing interest in kindling as a model of the interictal (i.e. between-seizures) changes in emotionality that accompany certain forms of epilepsy. Despite the extensive use of the kindling model, little consideration has been given to the role played by the cues regularly associated with the delivery of the kindling stimulations. However, we have recently demonstrated that cues associated with the standard kindling protocol (e.g. the stimulation environment) produce conditioned effects on both the motor seizures and interictal behavior of rats and that some kindling sites, such as the amygdala, produce conditioned interictal behaviors that are defensive in nature. The implications that these findings have for the study of interictal behavioral changes in particular and to kindling research in general are discussed.},

  volume = {16},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is etiologically heterogeneous, and a substantial proportion of MCI subjects will develop different dementia disorders. One subtype of this syndrome, amnestic MCI, occurs preferentially but not exclusively in prodromal AD and is characterized by defined deficits of episodic memory.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS

For a 2-year, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study MCI patients, presenting with an amnestic syndrome but not necessarily based on presumed prodromal AD were randomized.

INTERVENTION

Patients received (a) a combination of 16 mg galantamine plus 20 mg memantine, or (b) 16 mg galantamine alone or (c) placebo.

MEASUREMENTS

The primary objective was to explore the differential impact of these interventions on the progression to dementia and on cognitive changes as measured by the ADAScog.

RESULTS

After recruitment of 232 subjects, the trial was halted before reaching the planned sample size, because safety concerns arose in other studies with galantamine in MCI. This resulted in a variable treatment duration of 2-52 weeks. The statistical analysis plan was amended for studying cognitive effects of discontinuing the study medication, which was done separately for galantamine and memantine, and under double-blind conditions. There was one death, no unexpected severe adverse events, and no differences of severe adverse events between the treatment arms. The cognitive changes on the ADAScog were not different among the groups. Only for the subgroup of amnestic MCI with presumed AD etiology, a significant improvement of ADAScog score over placebo before the discontinuation of medication was observed, while amnestic MCI presumably due to other etiologies showed no cognitive changes with broad variation. Cognitive improvement was numerically larger in the combination treatment group than under galantamine alone. Patients who received placebo declined as expected. Discontinuation of galantamine, either as part of the combination regimen or as mono treatment, resulted in a transient decline of the ADAScog score in amnestic MCI of presumed AD etiology, while discontinuation of Memantine did not change the cognitive status.

CONCLUSION

In an interrupted trial with amnestic MCI subjects the combination of galantamine plus memantine were generally well tolerated. In the subgroup of MCI subjects with presumed AD etiology, a cognitive benefit of a short-term combination treatment of galantamine plus memantine was observed, and cognitive decline occurred after discontinuation of galantamine.},

These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

Recent in vivo imaging studies demonstrate that long-term plasticity of inhibitory circuits is manifested at an anatomical level. Changes in sensory experience drive structural remodeling in inhibitory interneurons in a cell-type and circuit-specific manner. Inhibitory synapse formation and elimination can occur with a great deal of spatial and temporal precision and are locally coordinated with excitatory synaptic changes on the same neuron. We suggest that the specificity of inhibitory synapse dynamics may serve to differentially modulate activity across the dendritic arbor, to selectively tune parts of a local circuit, or potentially discriminate between activities in distinct local circuits. We further review evidence suggesting that inhibitory circuit structural changes instruct excitatory/inhibitory balance while enabling functional reorganization to occur through Hebbian forms of plasticity.},

The dentate gyrus (DG), in addition to its role in learning and memory, is increasingly implicated in~the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. Here, we show that, dependent on their position along the~dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus, DG granule cells (GCs) control specific features of anxiety and contextual learning. Using optogenetic techniques to either elevate or decrease GC activity, we demonstrate that GCs in the dorsal DG control exploratory drive and encoding, not retrieval, of contextual fear memories. In contrast, elevating the~activity of GCs in the ventral DG has no effect on contextual learning but powerfully suppresses innate anxiety. These results suggest that strategies aimed at modulating the excitability of the ventral DG~may be beneficial for the treatment of anxiety disorders.},

Hippocampi were processed according to a modification of the Golgi method. Dendritic bifurcations from pyramidal neurons in both the oriens-alveus and the striatum radiatum; as well as spine density and proportions of thin, stubby, mushroom-shaped, wide, ramified, and double spines in a 50 microm length segment of an oblique dendrite branching from the apical dendrite of the hippocampal CA1 remaining pyramidal neurons were evaluated. No impregnated CA1 pyramidal neurons were found in the ischemic-vehicle-treated rats. CA1 pyramidal neurons from ischemic-melatonin-treated rats showed stick-like and less ramified dendrites than those seen in intact control neurons. In addition, lesser density of spines, lower proportional density of thin spines, and higher proportional density of mushroom spines were counted in ischemic-melatonin-treated animals than those in the sinuously branched dendrites of the intact control group. These cytoarchitectural arrangements seem to be compatible with place learning and memory functions long after ischemia and melatonin neuroprotection.},

We tested the hypothesis that a single episode of neonatal seizures (sNS) on rat postnatal day (P) 7 permanently impairs hippocampal-dependent function in mature (P60) rats because of long-lasting changes at the synaptic level.MethodssNS was induced with subcutaneously injected kainate on P7. Learning, memory, mossy fiber sprouting, spine density, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and glutamate receptor expression and subcellular distribution were measured at P60.ResultssNS selectively impaired working memory in a hippocampal-dependent radial arm water-maze task without inducing mossy fiber sprouting or altering spine density. sNS impaired CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation and enhanced long-term depression. Subcellular fractionation and cross-linking, used to determine whether glutamate receptor trafficking underlies the alterations of memory and synaptic plasticity, demonstrated that sNS induced a selective reduction in the membrane pool of glutamate receptor 1 subunits. sNS induced a decrease in the total amount of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2A and an increase in the primary subsynaptic scaffold, PSD-95.InterpretationThese molecular consequences are consistent with the alterations in plasticity and memory caused by sNS at the synaptic level.

  abstract = {Competitive synaptic interactions between principal neurons (PNs) with differing intrinsic excitability were recently shown to determine which dorsal~lateral amygdala (LAd) neurons are recruited into a fear memory trace. Here, we explored the contribution of these competitive interactions in determining the stimulus specificity of conditioned fear associations. To this end, we used a realistic biophysical computational model of LAd that included multi-compartment conductance-based models of 800 PNs and 200 interneurons. To reproduce the continuum of spike frequency adaptation displayed by PNs, the model included three subtypes of PNs with high, intermediate, and low spike frequency adaptation. In addition, the model network integrated spatially differentiated patterns of excitatory and inhibitory connections within LA, dopaminergic and noradrenergic inputs, extrinsic thalamic and cortical tone afferents to simulate conditioned stimuli as well as shock inputs for the unconditioned stimulus. Last, glutamatergic synapses in the model could undergo activity-dependent plasticity. Our results suggest that plasticity at both excitatory (PN-PN) and di-synaptic inhibitory (PN-ITN and, particularly, ITN-PN) connections are major determinants of the synaptic competition governing the assignment of PNs to the memory trace. The model also revealed that training-induced potentiation of PN-PN synapses promotes, whereas that of ITN-PN synapses opposes, stimulus generalization. Indeed, suppressing plasticity of PN-PN synapses increased, whereas preventing plasticity of interneuronal synapses decreased the CS specificity of PN recruitment. Overall, our results indicate that the plasticity configuration imprinted in the network by synaptic competition ensures memory specificity. Given that anxiety disorders are characterized by tendency to generalize learned fear to safe stimuli or situations, understanding how plasticity of intrinsic LAd synapses regulates the specificity of learned fear is an important challenge for future experimental studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia (vCIND) is a prevalent and potentially preventable disorder. Clinical presentation of the small-vessel subcortical subtype may be insidious, and differential difficulties can arise with mild cognitive impairment. We investigated EEG parameters in subcortical vCIND in comparison with amnestic multidomain mild cognitive impairment to determine the additional diagnostic value of quantitative EEG in this setting.
METHODS: Fifty-seven community-residing patients with an uneventful central neurologic history and first presentation of cognitive decline without dementia were included. Neuropsychological test results were correlated with EEG parameters. Predictive values for vCIND and amnestic multidomain mild cognitive impairment were calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression modeling.
RESULTS: Vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia and amnestic multidomain mild cognitive impairment differed with regard to the EEG (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratio (DTABR) and pairwise derived brain symmetry index. We found statistically significant correlations between pairwise derived brain symmetry index and immediate verbal memory, immediate global memory, verbal recognition, working memory, and mean memory score in vCIND. Verbal fluency (odds ratio: 1.54, 95\% confidence interval: 1.04-2.28, P = 0.033) and (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratio (odds ratio: 2.28, 95\% confidence interval: 1.06-4.94, P = 0.036) emerged as independent diagnostic predictors for vCIND with an overall correct classification rate of 95.0\%.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that EEG is of additional value in the differential diagnosis and follow-up of patients presenting with cognitive decline. These findings may have an impact on memory care.},

Here, we review recent electrophysiological studies indicating that neurons in the lateral amygdala encode aversive memories during the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning. Studies that combine unit recording with brain lesions and pharmacological inactivation provide evidence that the lateral amygdala is a crucial locus of fear memory. Extinction of fear memory reduces associative plasticity in the lateral amygdala and involves the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Understanding the signalling of aversive memory by amygdala neurons opens new avenues for research into the neural systems that support fear behaviour.},

  abstract = {Bidirectional changes in synaptic strength are the proposed cellular correlate for information storage in the brain. Plasticity of intrinsic excitability, however, may also be critical for regulating the firing of neurons during mnemonic tasks. We demonstrated previously that the induction long-term potentiation was accompanied by a persistent decrease in CA1 pyramidal neuron excitability (Fan et al., 2005). We show here that induction of long-term depression (LTD) by 3 Hz pairing of back-propagating action potentials with Schaffer collateral EPSPs was accompanied by an overall increase in CA1 neuronal excitability. This increase was observed as an increase in the number of action potentials elicited by somatic current injection and was caused by an increase in neuronal input resistance. After LTD, voltage sag during hyperpolarizing current injections and subthreshold resonance frequency were decreased. All changes were blocked by ZD7288 (4-ethylphenylamino-1,2-dimethyl-6-methylaminopyrimidinium chloride), suggesting that a physiological loss of dendritic h-channels was responsible for the increase in excitability. Furthermore, block of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) or protein kinase C prevented the increase in excitability, whereas the group 1 mGluR agonist DHPG [(RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine] mimicked the effects. We conclude that 3 Hz synaptic stimulation downregulates Ih via activation of group 1 mGluRs and subsequent stimulation of protein kinase C. We propose these changes as part of a homeostatic and bidirectional control mechanism for intrinsic excitability during learning.},

Pathway-specific optogenetic manipulations demonstrate that the activity balance between pathways is causally involved in fear extinction. Together, our findings demonstrate that, although intermingled locally, long-range connectivity defines distinct subpopulations of amygdala projection neurons and indicate that the formation of long-term extinction memories depends on the balance of activity between two defined amygdala-prefrontal pathways.},

Those with high baseline stress levels are more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While meditation may reduce stress and alter the hippocampus and default mode network (DMN), little is known about its impact in these populations. Our objective was to conduct a ``proof of concept'' trial to determine whether Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) would improve DMN connectivity and reduce hippocampal atrophy among adults with MCI. 14 adults with MCI were randomized to MBSR vs. usual care and underwent resting state fMRI at baseline and follow-up. Seed based functional connectivity was applied using posterior cingulate cortex as seed. Brain morphometry analyses were performed using FreeSurfer. The results showed that after the intervention, MBSR participants had increased functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral medial prefrontal cortex and left hippocampus compared to controls. In addition, MBSR participants had trends of less bilateral hippocampal volume atrophy than control participants. These preliminary results indicate that in adults with MCI, MBSR may have a positive impact on the regions of the brain most related to MCI and AD. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer-follow-up are needed to further investigate the results from this pilot study.},

The gfp gene is widely used as a marker because of its very useful properties such as high stability, minimal toxicity, non-invasive detection and the ability to generate the green light without addition of external cofactors and without application of expensive equipment. Various applications of that reporter gene were showed starting from monitoring of microorganism's survival in complex biological systems such as activated sludge to biodegradation of chemical compounds in soil. GFP allowed the detection, determination of spatial location and enumeration of bacterial cells from diverse environmental samples such as biofilm and water. The gfp as a biomarker was very useful in monitoring of gene expression and protein localisation in bacterial cells, too. The techniques with using gfp marker promise to supply a better understanding of environmental processes. It can make possible to use that knowledge in designing more effective and more efficient methods of biodegradation of toxic compounds from different environments.},

Networks of GABAergic neurons are key elements in the generation of \ensuremath{\gamma} oscillations in the brain. Computational studies suggested that the emergence of coherent oscillations requires hyperpolarizing inhibition. Here, we show that GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition in mature interneurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus is shunting rather than hyperpolarizing. Unexpectedly, when shunting inhibition is incorporated into a structured interneuron network model with fast and strong synapses, coherent oscillations emerge. In comparison to hyperpolarizing inhibition, networks with shunting inhibition show several advantages. First, oscillations are generated with smaller tonic excitatory drive. Second, network frequencies are tuned to the \ensuremath{\gamma} band. Finally, robustness against heterogeneity in the excitatory drive is markedly improved. In single interneurons, shunting inhibition shortens the interspike interval for low levels of drive but prolongs it for high levels, leading to homogenization of neuronal firing rates. Thus, shunting inhibition may confer increased robustness to \ensuremath{\gamma} oscillations in the brain.},

Infants and children are at a high risk for seizures compared with adults. Although most seizures in children are benign and result in no long-term consequences, increasing experimental animal data strongly suggest that frequent or prolonged seizures in the developing brain result in long-lasting sequelae. Such seizures may intervene with developmental programmes and lead to inadequate construction of cortical networks rather than induction of neuronal cell loss. As a consequence, the deleterious actions of seizures are strongly age dependent: seizures have different effects on immature or migrating neurons endowed with few synapses and more developed neurons that express hundreds of functional synapses. This differential effect is even more important in human beings and subhuman primates who have an extended brain development period. Seizures also beget seizures during maturation and result in a replay of development programmes, which suggests that epileptogenesis recapitulates ontogenesis. Therefore, to understand seizures and their consequences in the developing brain, it is essential to determine how neuronal activity modulates the main steps of cortical formation. In this Review, we present basic developmental principles obtained from animal studies and examine the long-lasting consequences of epilepsy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The contribution of seizures to cognitive changes remains controversial. We tested the hypothesis that a single episode of neonatal seizures (sNS) on rat postnatal day (P) 7 permanently impairs hippocampal-dependent function in mature (P60) rats because of long-lasting changes at the synaptic level.

METHODS

sNS was induced with subcutaneously injected kainate on P7. Learning, memory, mossy fiber sprouting, spine density, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and glutamate receptor expression and subcellular distribution were measured at P60.

RESULTS

sNS selectively impaired working memory in a hippocampal-dependent radial arm water-maze task without inducing mossy fiber sprouting or altering spine density. sNS impaired CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation and enhanced long-term depression. Subcellular fractionation and cross-linking, used to determine whether glutamate receptor trafficking underlies the alterations of memory and synaptic plasticity, demonstrated that sNS induced a selective reduction in the membrane pool of glutamate receptor 1 subunits. sNS induced a decrease in the total amount of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2A and an increase in the primary subsynaptic scaffold, PSD-95.

INTERPRETATION

These molecular consequences are consistent with the alterations in plasticity and memory caused by sNS at the synaptic level. Our data demonstrate the cognitive impact of sNS and associate memory deficits with specific alterations in glutamatergic synaptic function.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the biological aging process. Our previous results and those of others suggest that one possible mechanism is based on the loss of glutathione (GSH), a multifunctional tripeptide present in high concentrations in nearly all living cells. The recent finding that life-long dietary restriction of the GSH precursor methionine (Met) resulted in increased longevity in rats led us to hypothesize that adaptive changes in Met and GSH metabolism had occurred, leading to enhanced GSH status. To test this, blood and tissue GSH levels were measured at different ages throughout the life span in F344 rats on control or Met-restricted diets. Met restriction resulted in a 42\% increase in mean and 44\% increase in maximum life span, and in 43\% lower body weight compared to controls (P \ensuremath{<} 0.001). Increases in blood GSH levels of 81\% and 164\% were observed in mature and old Met-restricted animals, respectively (P \ensuremath{<} 0.001). Liver was apparently the source for this increase as hepatic GSH levels decreased to 40\% of controls. Except for a 25\% decrease in kidney, GSH was unchanged in other tissues. All changes in GSH occurred as early as 2 months after the start of the diet. Altogether, these results suggest that dramatic adaptations in sulfur amino acid metabolism occur as a result of chronic Met restriction, leading to increases in blood GSH levels and conservation of tissue GSH during aging.},

Selectively deleting neurons overexpressing CREB (but not a similar portion of random LA neurons) after learning blocked expression of that fear memory.

Previous studies have clearly identified the amygdala as a key brain structure for acquisition and storage of fear memory traces. Whereas the majority of this work has focused on principal cells and glutamatergic transmission and its plasticity, recent studies have started to shed light on the intricate roles of local inhibitory circuits. Here, we review current understanding and emerging concepts of how local inhibitory circuits in the amygdala control the acquisition, expression, and extinction of conditioned fear at different levels.},

  abstract = {The polyamines are essential for cellular growth and differentiation. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which catalyses the first step in the biosynthesis of the polyamines, has a very fast turnover and is subject to a strong feedback control by the polyamines. In the present study, we show that overexpression of a metabolically stable ODC in CHO cells induced a massive cell death unless the cells were grown in the presence of the ODC inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). Cells overexpressing wild-type (unstable) ODC, on the other hand, were not dependent on the presence of DFMO for their growth. The induction of cell death was correlated with a dramatic increase in cellular putrescine levels. Analysis using flow cytometry revealed perturbed cell cycle kinetics, with a large accumulation of cells with sub-G1 amounts of DNA, which is a typical sign of apoptosis. Another strong indication of apoptosis was the finding that one of the key enzymes in the apoptotic process, caspase-3, was induced when DFMO was omitted from the growth medium. Furthermore, inhibition of the caspase activity significantly reduced the recruitment of cells to the sub-G1 fraction. In conclusion, deregulation of polyamine homeostasis may negatively affect cell proliferation and eventually lead to cell death by apoptosis if putrescine levels become too high.},

  abstract = {We explore a synaptic plasticity model that incorporates recent findings that potentiation and depression can be induced by precisely timed pairs of synaptic events and postsynaptic spikes. In addition we include the observation that strong synapses undergo relatively less potentiation than weak synapses, whereas depression is independent of synaptic strength. After random stimulation, the synaptic weights reach an equilibrium distribution which is stable, unimodal, and has positive skew. This weight distribution compares favorably to the distributions of quantal amplitudes and of receptor number observed experimentally in central neurons and contrasts to the distribution found in plasticity models without size-dependent potentiation. Also in contrast to those models, which show strong competition between the synapses, stable plasticity is achieved with little competition. Instead, competition can be introduced by including a separate mechanism that scales synaptic strengths multiplicatively as a function of postsynaptic activity. In this model, synaptic weights change in proportion to how correlated they are with other inputs onto the same postsynaptic neuron. These results indicate that stable correlation-based plasticity can be achieved without introducing competition, suggesting that plasticity and competition need not coexist in all circuits or at all developmental stages.},

The effects of conditioning were greatest on the shortest latency (less than 15 ms) components of the tone-elicited responses, consistent with the hypothesis that direct projections from the auditory thalamus to LA are an important link in the circuitry through which rapid behavioral responses are controlled in the presence of conditioned fear stimuli.},

The first 10 patients who have utilized this program include patients with memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), or subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). Nine of the 10 displayed subjective or objective improvement in cognition beginning within 3-6 months, with the one failure being a patient with very late stage AD. Six of the patients had had to discontinue working or were struggling with their jobs at the time of presentation, and all were able to return to work or continue working with improved performance. Improvements have been sustained, and at this time the longest patient follow-up is two and one-half years from initial treatment, with sustained and marked improvement. These results suggest that a larger, more extensive trial of this therapeutic program is warranted. The results also suggest that, at least early in the course, cognitive decline may be driven in large part by metabolic processes. Furthermore, given the failure of monotherapeutics in AD to date, the results raise the possibility that such a therapeutic system may be useful as a platform on which drugs that would fail as monotherapeutics may succeed as key components of a therapeutic system.},

  abstract = {Novel motor skills are learned through repetitive practice and, once acquired, persist long after training stops. Earlier studies have shown that such learning induces an increase in the efficacy of synapses in the primary motor cortex, the persistence of which is associated with retention of the task. However, how motor learning affects neuronal circuitry at the level of individual synapses and how long-lasting memory is structurally encoded in the intact brain remain unknown. Here we show that synaptic connections in the living mouse brain rapidly respond to motor-skill learning and permanently rewire. Training in a forelimb reaching task leads to rapid (within an hour) formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on the output pyramidal neurons in the contralateral motor cortex. Although selective elimination of spines that existed before training gradually returns the overall spine density back to the original level, the new spines induced during learning are preferentially stabilized during subsequent training and endure long after training stops. Furthermore, we show that different motor skills are encoded by different sets of synapses. Practice of novel, but not previously learned, tasks further promotes dendritic spine formation in adulthood. Our findings reveal that rapid, but long-lasting, synaptic reorganization is closely associated with motor learning. The data also suggest that stabilized neuronal connections are the foundation of durable motor memory.},

Although spines are often characterized by a mushroom-like morphology, they come in a wide range of sizes and shapes, even within the same dendrite. In a developing brain, spines exhibit a high degree of structural and functional plasticity, reflecting the formation and elimination of synapses during the maturation of neuronal circuits. The morphology of spines in developing neurons is affected by synaptic activity, hence contributing to the experience-dependent refinement of neuronal circuits, learning, and memory. Thus, understanding spine dynamics and its regulation is of central importance to studies of synaptic plasticity in the brain. The challenge has been to develop a computer-based assay that will quantitatively assess the three-dimensional change in spine movements caused by various stimuli and experimental conditions. Here, we provide detailed protocols for cell plating, transient transfections, and time-lapse imaging of dendritic spines.

Although many transcription factors are known to control important aspects of neural development, the genome-wide programs that are directly regulated by these factors are not known. We have characterized the genetic program that is activated by MEF2, a key regulator of activity-dependent synapse development. These MEF2 target genes have diverse functions at synapses, revealing a broad role for MEF2 in synapse development. Several of the MEF2 targets are mutated in human neurological disorders including epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders, suggesting that these disorders may be caused by disruption of an activity-dependent gene program that controls synapse development. Our analyses also reveal that neuronal activity promotes alternative polyadenylation site usage at many of the MEF2 target genes, leading to the production of truncated mRNAs that may have different functions than their full-length counterparts. Taken together, these analyses suggest that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor MEF2 regulates an intricate transcriptional program in neurons that controls synapse development.},

Capitalizing on this knowledge, it has been postulated that targeting many of the same mechanisms, including CREB activation, AMPA/NMDA receptor trafficking, neuromodulation (e.g., via dopamine, adrenaline, cortisol, or acetylcholine) and metabolic processes (e.g., via glucose and insulin) may all lead to the enhancement of memory. These and other mechanisms and/or approaches have been tested via genetic or pharmacological methods in animal models, and several have been investigated in humans as well. In addition, a number of behavioral methods, including exercise and reconsolidation, may also serve to strengthen and enhance memories. By utilizing this information and continuing to investigate these promising avenues, memory enhancement may indeed be achieved in the future.},

  abstract = {The underlying neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory have been heavily explored using associative learning paradigms. Two of the more commonly employed learning paradigms have been contextual and delay fear conditioning. In fear conditioning, a subject learns to associate a neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus; CS), such as a tone or the context of the room, with a fear provoking stimulus (unconditioned stimulus; US), such as a mild footshock. Utilizing these two paradigms, various analyses have elegantly demonstrated that the amygdala plays a role in both fear-related associative learning paradigms. However, the amygdala's involvement in trace fear conditioning, a forebrain-dependent fear associative learning paradigm that has been suggested to tap into higher cognitive processes, has not been closely investigated. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the specific amygdala nuclei involved with trace fear conditioning has not been examined. The present study used Arc expression as an activity marker to determine the amygdala's involvement in trace fear associative learning and to further explore involvement of specific amygdalar nuclei. Arc is an immediate early gene that has been shown to be associated with neuronal activation and is believed to be necessary for neuronal plasticity. Findings from the present study demonstrated that trace-conditioned mice, compared to backward-conditioned (stimulation-control), delay-conditioned and na{\"\i}ve mice, exhibited elevated amygdalar Arc expression in the basolateral (BLA) but not the central (CeA) or the lateral amygdala (LA). These findings are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that the amygdala plays a critical role in trace conditioning. Furthermore, these findings parallel studies demonstrating hippocampal-BLA activation following contextual fear conditioning, suggesting that trace fear conditioning and contextual fear conditioning may involve similar amygdala nuclei. Together, findings from this study demonstrate similarities in the pathway for trace and contextual fear conditioning, and further suggest possible underlying mechanisms for acquisition and consolidation of these two types of fear-related learning.},

Yet, there remains a lack of clarity in the operationalization of this construct, and underlying mechanisms. Here, we provide an integrative theoretical framework and systems-based neurobiological model that explains the mechanisms by which mindfulness reduces biases related to self-processing and creates a sustainable healthy mind. Mindfulness is described through systematic mental training that develops meta-awareness (self-awareness), an ability to effectively modulate one's behavior (self-regulation), and a positive relationship between self and other that transcends self-focused needs and increases prosocial characteristics (self-transcendence). This framework of self-awareness, -regulation, and -transcendence (S-ART) illustrates a method for becoming aware of the conditions that cause (and remove) distortions or biases. The development of S-ART through meditation is proposed to modulate self-specifying and narrative self-networks through an integrative fronto-parietal control network. Relevant perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral neuropsychological processes are highlighted as supporting mechanisms for S-ART, including intention and motivation, attention regulation, emotion regulation, extinction and reconsolidation, prosociality, non-attachment, and decentering. The S-ART framework and neurobiological model is based on our growing understanding of the mechanisms for neurocognition, empirical literature, and through dismantling the specific meditation practices thought to cultivate mindfulness. The proposed framework will inform future research in the contemplative sciences and target specific areas for development in the treatment of psychological disorders.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the increasing prevalence of dementia, any intervention that can effectively slow the deterioration of cognitive function is of great importance.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of a human-computer interaction-based comprehensive cognitive training program in cognitively impaired elderly individuals living in a nursing home.
METHODS: All subjects, who were aged \ensuremath{\geq}70 years and had cognitive impairment, were randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 19) or a control group (n = 14). The intervention group received human-computer interaction-based comprehensive cognitive training for 24 weeks. Neuropsychological examinations were conducted before and after this period. The intervention group was subdivided into two groups according to the scores of global cortical atrophy (GCA) to evaluate the impact of training effectiveness on GCA.
RESULTS: After 24 weeks, neither group showed a significant change compared with baseline cognitive examinations. However, there was a tendency for greater improvement in memory, language, and visuospatial abilities for the intervention group as compared with controls. Patients with mild cognitive impairment showed improvements in language and visuospatial capacity, while patients with dementia showed improvements in attention/orientation, memory, language, and fluency. However, none of these findings were statistically significant. The results for the intervention subgroups showed that visuospatial ability improvement was significantly greater among those with a global cortical atrophy score of \ensuremath{\leq}15 (p \ensuremath{<} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Human-computer interaction-based comprehensive training may improve cognitive functions among cognitively impaired elderly individuals. The training effect was most prominent among those with milder cerebral atrophy.},

  abstract = {Humans and animals can learn that specific sensory cues in the environment predict aversive events through a form of associative learning termed fear conditioning. This learning occurs when the sensory cues are paired with an aversive event occuring in close temporal proximity. Activation of lateral amygdala (LA) pyramidal neurons by aversive stimuli is thought to drive the formation of these associative fear memories; yet, there have been no direct tests of this hypothesis. Here we demonstrate that viral-targeted, tissue-specific expression of the light-activated channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in LA pyramidal cells permitted optical control of LA neuronal activity. Using this approach we then paired an auditory sensory cue with optical stimulation of LA pyramidal neurons instead of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently presentation of the tone alone produced behavioral fear responses. These results demonstrate in vivo optogenetic control of LA neurons and provide compelling support for the idea that fear learning is instructed by aversive stimulus-induced activation of LA pyramidal cells.},

The BA is one of the main targets for hippocampal information, a brain structure critical for contextual learning, which integrates several discrete stimuli into a single configural representation. Congruent with the hodology, selective neurotoxic damage to the BA results in impairments in contextual, but not auditory, fear conditioning, similarly to the behavioral impairments found after hippocampal damage. This study evaluated the effects of muscimol-induced reversible inactivation of the BA during a simultaneous contextual and auditory fear conditioning training on later fear responses to both the context and the tone, tested separately, without muscimol administration. As compared to control rats micro-infused with vehicle, subjects micro-infused with muscimol before training exhibited, during testing without muscimol, significant reduction of freezing responses to the conditioned context, but not to the conditioned tone. Therefore, reversible inactivation of the BA during training impaired contextual, but not auditory fear conditioning, thus confirming and extending similar behavioral observations following selective neurotoxic damage to the BA and, in addition, revealing that this effect is not related to the lack of a functional BA during testing.},

However, the morphological mechanisms underlying these impairments remain unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the spine density and the proportion of thin, mushroom, stubby, wide, branched and double spines on pyramidal neuron dendrites in the hippocampal CA1 field of young and aged rats. These parameters were assessed both before and after evaluating place learning and reference memory in the Morris water maze. Aged rats adopted an egocentric strategy to resolve the task, swimming slower and further, and taking longer to locate the sunken platform. While probe trials revealed that aged animals could recall the platform position, these animals spent more time exploring incorrect quadrants than young rats. An increase in spine density was observed after task performance in both young and aged rats, but aging provoked a decrease in the density of thin spines. In addition, there was an increase in the density of mushroom and wide spines in aged animals after task performance as compared with the untested aged counterparts. Moreover, in aged animals there were fewer thin spines and more wide spines after task performance than in the young tested animals. These findings support the view that aging attenuates but does not abolish spatial memory, a process that may be associated with plastic changes in the type of dendritic spines on aged hippocampal CA1 neurons.},

  abstract = {A central problem in motor research has been to understand how sensory signals are transformed to generate a goal-directed movement. This problem has been formulated as a set of coordinate transformations that begins with an extrinsic coordinate frame representing the spatial location of a target and ends with an intrinsic coordinate frame describing muscle activation patterns. Insight into this process of sensorimotor transformation can be gained by examining the coordinate frames of neuronal activity in interconnected regions of the brain. We recorded the activity of neurons in primary motor cortex (M1) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in a monkey trained to perform a task which dissociates three major coordinate frames of wrist movement: muscle, wrist joint, and an extrinsic coordinate frame. We found three major types of neurons in M1 and PMv. The first type was termed 'extrinsic-like'. The activity of these neurons appeared to encode the direction of movement in space independent of the patterns of wrist muscle activity or joint movement that produced the movements. The second type was termed 'extrinsic-like with gain modulation'. The activity of these neurons appeared to encode the direction of movement in space, but the magnitude (gain) of neuronal activity depended on the posture of the forearm. The third type was termed 'muscle-like' since their activity co-varied with muscle activity. The great majority of the directionally-tuned neurons in the PMv were classified as 'extrinsic-like' (48/59, 81\%). A smaller group was classified as 'extrinsic-like with gain modulation' (7/59, 12\%). In M1, the three types of neurons were more equally represented. Our results raise the possibility that cortical processing between M1 and PMv may contribute to a sensorimotor transformation between extrinsic and intrinsic coordinate frames. Recent modeling studies have demonstrated the computational plausibility of such a process.},

  abstract = {High-frequency stimulation of excitatory synapses in many regions of the brain triggers a lasting increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP) and believed to contribute to learning and memory. One hypothesis proposed to account for the stability and properties of this functional plasticity is a structural remodeling of spine synapses. This possibility has recently received support from several studies. It has been found that spines are highly dynamic structures, that they can be formed very rapidly, and that synaptic activity and calcium modulate changes in spine shape and formation of new spines. Ultrastructural analyses bring additional support to these observations and suggest that LTP is associated with a remodeling of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and a process of spine duplication. This new information is reviewed and interpreted in light of other recent advances concerning the mechanisms of LTP and especially the role of postsynaptic glutamate receptor turnover in this form of plasticity. Taken together, a view is emerging that suggests that morphologic changes of spine synapses are associated with LTP and that they not only correlate with, but probably also contribute to the increase in synaptic transmission.},

However, despite recent exciting technical advances, it has not yet proved possible to confirm experimentally this intuitively appealing hypothesis. Artificial neural networks offer an alternative methodology as they permit continuous monitoring of individual connection weights during learning and retention. In such models, ongoing alterations in connection weights are required if a network is to retain previously stored material while learning new information. Thus, the duration of synaptic change does not necessarily define the persistence of a memory; rather, it is likely that a regulated balance of synaptic stability and synaptic plasticity is required for optimal memory retention in real neuronal circuits.},

Fewer cortical neurons responded to stimulation of the trained whisker than in controls, yet their response strength was enhanced. These responses were not observed in mice exposed to a nonassociative learning procedure. Our results define how the cortical representation of a sensory stimulus is shaped by associative fear learning.

  doi = {10.1038/nature08759},
  abstract = {Behavioural learning depends on the brain's capacity to respond to instructive experience and is often enhanced during a juvenile sensitive period. How instructive experience acts on the juvenile brain to trigger behavioural learning remains unknown. In vitro studies show that forms of synaptic strengthening thought to underlie learning are accompanied by an increase in the stability, number and size of dendritic spines, which are the major sites of excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate brain. In vivo imaging studies in sensory cortical regions reveal that these structural features can be affected by disrupting sensory experience and that spine turnover increases during sensitive periods for sensory map formation. These observations support two hypotheses: first, the increased capacity for behavioural learning during a sensitive period is associated with enhanced spine dynamics on sensorimotor neurons important for the learned behaviour; second, instructive experience rapidly stabilizes and strengthens these dynamic spines. Here we report a test of these hypotheses using two-photon in vivo imaging to measure spine dynamics in zebra finches, which learn to sing by imitating a tutor song during a juvenile sensitive period. Spine dynamics were measured in the forebrain nucleus HVC, the proximal site where auditory information merges with an explicit song motor representation, immediately before and after juvenile finches first experienced tutor song. Higher levels of spine turnover before tutoring correlated with a greater capacity for subsequent song imitation. In juveniles with high levels of spine turnover, hearing a tutor song led to the rapid ( approximately 24-h) stabilization, accumulation and enlargement of dendritic spines in HVC. Moreover, in vivo intracellular recordings made immediately before and after the first day of tutoring revealed robust enhancement of synaptic activity in HVC. These findings suggest that behavioural learning results when instructive experience is able to rapidly stabilize and strengthen synapses on sensorimotor neurons important for the control of the learned behaviour.},

Recordings from these implanted electrodes have a number of advantages over non-invasive recordings in terms of band width, spatial resolution, smaller vulnerability to artifacts and overall signal quality. However, an unresolved issue is that signals vary greatly across electrodes. Here, we examine the effect of blood vessels lying between an electrode and the cortex on signals recorded from subdural grid electrodes. Blood vessels of different sizes cover extensive parts of the cortex causing variations in the electrode-cortex connection across grids. The power spectral density of electrodes located on the cortex and electrodes located on blood vessels obtained from eight epilepsy patients is compared. We find that blood vessels affect the power spectral density of the recorded signal in a frequency-band-specific way, in that frequencies between 30 and 70 Hz are attenuated the most. Here, the signal is attenuated on average by 30-40\% compared to electrodes directly on the cortex. For lower frequencies this attenuation effect is less pronounced. We conclude that blood vessels influence the signal properties in a non-uniform manner.},

Twenty patients with AD and 20 age-matched controls were tested at baseline and after 1 year to evaluate the potential of synchronization to be a possible marker of AD progression. All the subjects had clinical evaluations and electroencephalography (EEG) at baseline and post 1 year. Hyposynchronization had an important effect in the medial temporal and frontal regions, while there were no significant effects for hypersynchronization. Hypersynchronized clusters changed more slowly with time (P = .067), whereas hyposynchronized clusters changed more quickly (P = .032). Hyposynchronized cluster-averaged S-estimator correlated negatively with progression of AD (r = -0.98769, P = .0103).

LTP has been studied most extensively in the hippocampus, but the relation between hippocampal LTP and memory has been difficult to establish. Here we explore the relation between LTP and memory in fear conditioning, an amygdala-dependent form of learning in which an innocuous conditioned stimulus (CS) elicits fear responses after being associatively paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). We have previously shown that LTP induction in pathways that transmit auditory CS information to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) increases auditory-evoked field potentials in this nucleus. Now we show that fear conditioning alters auditory CS-evoked responses in LA in the same way as LTP induction. The changes parallel the acquisition of CS-elicited fear behaviour, are enduring, and do not occur if the CS and US remain unpaired. LTP-like associative processes thus occur during fear conditioning, and these may underlie the long-term associative plasticity that constitutes memory of the conditioning experience.},

  abstract = {A rapidly growing literature strongly suggests that exercise, specifically aerobic exercise, may attenuate cognitive impairment and reduce dementia risk. We used PubMed (keywords exercise and cognition) and manuscript bibliographies to examine the published evidence of a cognitive neuroprotective effect of exercise. Meta-analyses of prospective studies documented a significantly reduced risk of dementia associated with midlife exercise; similarly, midlife exercise significantly reduced later risks of mild cognitive impairment in several studies. Among patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) documented better cognitive scores after 6 to 12 months of exercise compared with sedentary controls. Meta-analyses of RCTs of aerobic exercise in healthy adults were also associated with significantly improved cognitive scores. One year of aerobic exercise in a large RCT of seniors was associated with significantly larger hippocampal volumes and better spatial memory; other RCTs in seniors documented attenuation of age-related gray matter volume loss with aerobic exercise. Cross-sectional studies similarly reported significantly larger hippocampal or gray matter volumes among physically fit seniors compared with unfit seniors. Brain cognitive networks studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging display improved connectivity after 6 to 12 months of exercise. Animal studies indicate that exercise facilitates neuroplasticity via a variety of biomechanisms, with improved learning outcomes. Induction of brain neurotrophic factors by exercise has been confirmed in multiple animal studies, with indirect evidence for this process in humans. Besides a brain neuroprotective effect, physical exercise may also attenuate cognitive decline via mitigation of cerebrovascular risk, including the contribution of small vessel disease to dementia. Exercise should not be overlooked as an important therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract = {The field of neuroscience has, after a long period of looking the other way, again embraced emotion as an important research area. Much of the progress has come from studies of fear, and especially fear conditioning. This work has pinpointed the amygdala as an important component of the system involved in the acquisition, storage, and expression of fear memory and has elucidated in detail how stimuli enter, travel through, and exit the amygdala. Some progress has also been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie fear conditioning, and recent studies have also shown that the findings from experimental animals apply to the human brain. It is important to remember why this work on emotion succeeded where past efforts failed. It focused on a psychologically well-defined aspect of emotion, avoided vague and poorly defined concepts such as ``affect,'' ``hedonic tone,'' or ``emotional feelings,'' and used a simple and straightforward experimental approach. With so much research being done in this area today, it is important that the mistakes of the past not be made again. It is also time to expand from this foundation into broader aspects of mind and behavior},

  abstract = {Memory consolidation requires transcription and translation of new protein. Arc, an effector immediate early gene, and zif268, a regulatory transcription factor, have been implicated in synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. This study explored the temporal expression profiles of these proteins in the rat hippocampus following fear conditioning. We observed a time-dependent increase of Arc protein in the dorsal hippocampus 30-to-90-minute post training, returning to basal levels at 4 h. Zif268 protein levels, however, gradually increased at 30-minute post training before peaking in expression at 60 minute. The timing of hippocampal Arc and zif268 expression coincides with the critical period for protein synthesis-dependent memory consolidation following fear conditioning. However, the expression of Arc protein appears to be driven by context exploration, whereas, zif268 expression may be more specifically related to associative learning. These findings suggest that altered Arc and zif268 expression are related to neural plasticity during the formation of fear memory.},

  abstract = {The subventricular zone (SVZ) is a neurogenic region that continually gives rise to olfactory bulb (OB) GABAergic interneurons in mammals. The newly generated neuroblasts already express GABA while migrating to this structure along the rostral migratory stream (RMS). Here, we investigate in early postnatal rat if SVZ/RMS cells undertake the same synthetic pathway by which GABA is produced in differentiated neurons, i.e. the decarboxylation of glutamate by the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), or, if an alternative pathway, the conversion of putrescine into GABA, also contributes to GABA synthesis. We show here that GAD immunoreactivity is not significantly detectable within the SVZ/RMS. However, strong immunolabeling is found within the OB. Nevertheless, low GAD enzymatic activity (as compared with OB) is detected in the SVZ/RMS. SVZ/RMS explants convert approximately 30\% of all captured radiolabeled putrescine into GABA in vitro, showing that this pathway is important for GABA synthesis in the SVZ. We also show that SVZ/RMS, OB and choroid plexus explants are able to synthesize putrescine, as analyzed by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, providing neuroblasts with different sources of putrescine for GABA production. During early stages of neuroblast differentiation, in which neurotransmitter choice may still be undefined, an alternative pathway for GABA synthesis guarantees the production of GABA, necessary for neuroblast proliferation and migration in the SVZ/RMS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The spatial aspects of brain electrical activity can be assessed by equivalent EEG frequency band generators. We aimed to describe alterations of these EEG generators in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy aging and whether they could serve as predictive markers of AD in subjects at risk.
METHODS: The amplitude and 3-dimensional localization of equivalent EEG sources were evaluated using FFT dipole approximation in 38 mild AD patients, 31 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 24 healthy control subjects.
RESULTS: AD patients showed an increase of delta and theta global field power (GFP), which corresponds to the generalized EEG amplitude, as well as a reduction of alpha GFP when compared to the controls. A decrease of alpha and beta GFP was found in AD patients, as compared to the MCI subjects. With respect to topography in the antero-posterior direction, sources of alpha and beta activity shifted more anteriorly in AD patients compared to both the controls and MCI subjects. No significant difference was found between MCI and controls. Combined alpha and theta GFP were the best discriminating variables between AD patients and controls (84\% correct classification) and AD and MCI subjects (78\% correctly classified). MCI subjects were followed longitudinally (25 months on average) in order to compare differences in baseline EEG variables between MCI subjects who progressed to AD (PMCI) and those who remained stable (SMCI). Compared to SMCI, PMCI had decreased alpha GFP and a more anterior localization of sources of theta, alpha and beta frequency. In a linear discriminant analysis applied on baseline values of the two MCI subgroups, the best predictor of future development of AD was found to be antero-posterior localization of alpha frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: FFT dipole approximation and frequency analysis performed by conventional FFT showed comparable classification accuracy between the studied groups. We conclude that localization and amplitude of equivalent EEG sources could be promising markers of early AD.},

It is commonly addressed at two complementary levels of description and analysis: the cellular/synaptic level (synaptic consolidation) and the brain systems level (systems consolidation). This article focuses on selected recent advances in consolidation research, including the reconsolidation of long-term memory items, the brain mechanisms of transformation of the content and of cue-dependency of memory items over time, as well as the role of rest and sleep in consolidating and shaping memories. Taken together, the picture that emerges is of dynamic engrams that are formed, modified, and remodified over time at the systems level by using synaptic consolidation mechanisms as subroutines. This implies that, contrary to interpretations that have dominated neuroscience for a while, but similar to long-standing cognitive concepts, consolidation of at least some items in long-term memory may never really come to an end.},

Reconsolidation theory assumes that reactivation during wakefulness transiently destabilizes memories, requiring them to reconsolidate in order to persist. Memory reactivation also occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and is assumed to underlie the consolidating effect of sleep. Here, we tested whether the same principle of transient destabilization applies to memory reactivation during SWS. We reactivated memories in humans by presenting associated odor cues either during SWS or wakefulness. Reactivation was followed by an interference task to probe memory stability. As we expected, reactivation during waking destabilized memories. In contrast, reactivation during SWS immediately stabilized memories, thereby directly increasing their resistance to interference. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that reactivation during SWS mainly activated hippocampal and posterior cortical regions, whereas reactivation during wakefulness primarily activated prefrontal cortical areas. Our results show that reactivation of memory serves distinct functions depending on the brain state of wakefulness or sleep.},

  abstract = {Long-lasting modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability in cortical neurons underlies distinct stages of skill learning. However, whether individual differences in learning capabilities are dependent on the rate by which such learning-induced modifications occur has yet to be explored. Here we show that training rats in a simple olfactory-discrimination task results in the same enhanced excitability in piriform cortex neurons as previously shown after training in a much more complex olfactory-discrimination task. Based on their learning capabilities in the simple task, rats could be divided to two groups: fast performers and slow performers. The rate at which rats accomplished the skill to perform the simple task was correlated with the time course at which piriform cortex neurons increased their repetitive spike firing. Twelve hours after learning, neurons from fast performers had reduced spike frequency adaptation as compared with neurons from slow performers and controls. Three days after learning, spike frequency adaptation was reduced in neurons from SP, while neurons from fast performers increased their spike firing adaptation to the level of controls. Accordingly, the post-burst AHP was reduced in neurons from fast performers 12 h after learning and in neurons from slow performers 3 days after learning. Moreover, the differences in learning capabilities between fast performers and slow performers were maintained when examined in a different, complex olfactory-discrimination task. We suggest that the rate at which neuronal excitability is modified during learning may affect the behavioral flexibility of the animal.},

During sporulation, VPS13 is important for formation of the prospore membrane that encapsulates the daughter nuclei to give rise to spores. We report that VPS13 is required for multiple aspects of prospore membrane morphogenesis. VPS13 (1) promotes expansion of the prospore membrane through regulation of phosphatidylinositol phosphates, which in turn activate the phospholipase D, Spo14; (2) is required for a late step in cytokinesis that gives rise to spores; and (3) regulates a membrane-bending activity that generates intralumenal vesicles. These results demonstrate that Vps13 plays a broader role in membrane biology than previously known, which could have important implications for the functions of VPS13 orthologs in humans.},

The data further demonstrate Sec14 is required for proper trans-Golgi network (TGN)/endosomal dynamics in yeast. Paradoxically, combinatorial depletion of Sec14 and Tlg2 activities elicits trafficking defects from the endoplasmic reticulum, and these defects are accompanied by compromise of the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR failure occurs downstream of Hac1 mRNA splicing, and it is further accompanied by defects in TOR signaling. The data link TGN/endosomal dynamics with ceramide homeostasis, UPR activity, and TOR signaling in yeast, and they identify the Sit4 protein phosphatase as a primary conduit through which ceramides link to the UPR. We suggest combinatorial Sec14/Tlg2 dysfunction evokes inappropriate turnover of complex sphingolipids in endosomes. One result of this turnover is potentiation of ceramide-activated phosphatase-mediated down-regulation of the UPR. These results provide new insight into Sec14 function, and they emphasize the TGN/endosomal system as a central hub for homeostatic regulation in eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) is an ubiquitously expressed inducible regulator of a broad range of genes and plays a pivotal role in cell death and survival pathways. Three models of brain tolerance (ischemic, epileptic, and polyunsaturated fatty acid-induced preconditioning), known to confer resistance to neurons against ischemia or status epilepticus, were used to determine whether NFkappaB mediated the late preconditioning. A sublethal 3 min ischemia, a dose of 5 mg/kg kainic acid (KA5) or 500 nmol of linolenic acid (LIN500) led to a rapid increase of NFkappaB DNA-binding activity and nuclear translocation of p65 and p50 subunits of NFkappaB in neurons. Pretreatment with the NFkappaB inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate or kappaB decoy DNA blocked the increased DNA-binding activity and the nuclear translocation of NFkappaB and abolished the neuroprotective effects of different delayed preconditionings against severe ischemia or epilepsy. The inhibition of NFkappaB observed in rats preconditioned with 3 min ischemia, KA5 or LIN500 treatments compared with ischemic or epileptic controls was correlated with the prevention of the inducible degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaBalpha. Preconditioning probably inhibits the activation of NFkappaB by interfering with a pathway that leads to the direct transcriptional activation of IkappaBalpha by NFkappaB itself. The present work provides evidence that activation of NFkappaB is a crucial step in the signal transduction pathway that underlies the development of brain tolerance and may open new strategies in the prevention of cerebral diseases, such as ischemia or epilepsy.},

Some motor neurons branch and overgrow; others show altered synaptic organization. Expression of RPM-1 in the presynaptic mechanosensory neurons is sufficient to rescue phenotypes in these cells. Certain rpm-1 phenotypes are temperature sensitive, revealing that RPM-1 function can be bypassed by maintaining mutants at the permissive temperature at stages commensurate with synapse formation in wild-type animals.

We discuss how these approaches can be adapted for single-cell electroporation to manipulate specific cells genetically. These approaches thus permit the recording and manipulation of rare genetically, morphologically, and functionally distinct subsets of neurons in the intact nervous system.},

The most effective way to alleviate these side effects is to taper or discontinue dopamine agonist therapy. A subset of patients who taper a dopamine agonist, however, develop dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS), which has been defined as a severe, stereotyped cluster of physical and psychological symptoms that correlate with dopamine agonist withdrawal in a dose-dependent manner, cause clinically significant distress or social/occupational dysfunction, are refractory to levodopa and other dopaminergic medications, and cannot be accounted for by other clinical factors. The symptoms of DAWS include anxiety, panic attacks, dysphoria, depression, agitation, irritability, suicidal ideation, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, generalized pain, and drug cravings. The severity and prognosis of DAWS is highly variable. While some patients have transient symptoms and make a full recovery, others have a protracted withdrawal syndrome lasting for months to years, and therefore may be unwilling or unable to discontinue DA therapy. Impulse control disorders appear to be a major risk factor for DAWS, and are present in virtually all affected patients. Thus, patients who are unable to discontinue dopamine agonist therapy may experience chronic impulse control disorders. At the current time, there are no known effective treatments for DAWS. For this reason, providers are urged to use dopamine agonists judiciously, warn patients about the risks of DAWS prior to the initiation of dopamine agonist therapy, and follow patients closely for withdrawal symptoms during dopamine agonist taper.},

  abstract = {Learning and memory processes can be influenced by recent experience, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Enhanced plasticity during critical periods of early life is linked to differentiating parvalbumin (PV)-interneuron networks, suggesting that recent experience may modulate learning by targeting the differentiation state of PV neurons in the adult. Here we show that environmental enrichment and Pavlovian contextual fear conditioning induce opposite, sustained and reversible hippocampal PV-network configurations in adult mice. Specifically, enrichment promotes the emergence of large fractions of low-differentiation (low PV and GAD67 expression) basket cells with low excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic-density ratios, whereas fear conditioning leads to large fractions of high-differentiation (high PV and GAD67 expression) basket cells with high excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic-density ratios. Pharmacogenetic inhibition or activation of PV neurons was sufficient to induce such opposite low-PV-network or high-PV-network configurations, respectively. The low-PV-network configuration enhanced structural synaptic plasticity, and memory consolidation and retrieval, whereas these were reduced by the high-PV-network configuration. We then show that maze navigation learning induces a hippocampal low-PV-network configuration paralleled by enhanced memory and structural synaptic plasticity throughout training, followed by a shift to a high-PV-network configuration after learning completion. The shift to a low-PV-network configuration specifically involved increased vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-positive GABAergic boutons and synaptic transmission onto PV neurons. Closely comparable low- and high-PV-network configurations involving VIP boutons were specifically induced in primary motor cortex upon rotarod motor learning. These results uncover a network plasticity mechanism induced after learning through VIP\textendash{}PV microcircuit modulation, and involving large, sustained and reversible shifts in the configuration of PV basket-cell networks in the adult. This novel form of experience-related plasticity in the adult modulates memory consolidation, retrieval and learning, and might be harnessed for therapeutic strategies to promote cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection.},

Despite in vitro evidence, their causal contribution to cortical network activity and sensory information processing in vivo remains unresolved. Here we report that selective photostimulation of astrocytes with channelrhodopsin-2 in primary visual cortex enhances both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, through the activation of type 1a metabotropic glutamate receptors. Photostimulation of astrocytes in vivo increases the spontaneous firing of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory neurons, while excitatory and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) neurons show either an increase or decrease in their activity. Moreover, PV+ neurons show increased baseline visual responses and reduced orientation selectivity to visual stimuli, whereas excitatory and SOM+ neurons show either increased or decreased baseline visual responses together with complementary changes in orientation selectivity. Therefore, astrocyte activation, through the dual control of excitatory and inhibitory drive, influences neuronal integrative features critical for sensory information processing.},

As cell death activators such as ROS generation and decreased ATP can initiate tolerance, we tested whether other cellular elements normally associated with neuronal injury could add to this process. In an in vivo model of ischemic tolerance, we were surprised to observe widespread caspase 3 cleavage, without cell death, in preconditioned tissue. To dissect the preconditioning pathways activating caspases, and the mechanisms by which these proteases are held in check, we developed an in vitro model of excitotoxic tolerance. In this model, antioxidants and caspase inhibitors blocked ischemia-induced protection against N-methyl-d-aspartate toxicity. Moreover, agents that blocked preconditioning also attenuated induction of HSP 70; transient overexpression of a constitutive form of this protein prevented HSP 70 up-regulation and blocked tolerance. We outline a neuroprotective pathway where events normally associated with apoptotic cell death are critical for cell survival.},

Synaptic removal of AMPA receptors is necessary and sufficient to produce loss of dendritic spines and synaptic NMDA responses.

Viral tracing of the circuits engaged by primary sensory neurons has, however, been hampered by the absence of a genetically tractable anterograde transfer system. In this study, we demonstrate that rabies virus can infect sensory neurons in the somatosensory system, is subject to anterograde transsynaptic transfer from primary sensory to spinal target neurons, and can delineate output connectivity with third-order neurons. Anterograde transsynaptic transfer is a feature shared by other classes of primary sensory neurons, permitting the identification and potentially the manipulation of neural circuits processing sensory feedback within the mammalian CNS.},

Several drugs of abuse, act on VTA GABAergic neurons, and most studies have focused on local inhibitory connections. Relatively little is known about VTA GABA projection neurons and their connections to brain sites outside the VTA. This study employed viral-vector-mediated cell-type-specific anterograde tracing, classical retrograde tracing, and immunohistochemistry to characterize VTA GABA efferents throughout the brain. We found that VTA GABA neurons project widely to forebrain and brainstem targets, including the ventral pallidum, lateral and magnocellular preoptic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. Minor projections also go to central amygdala, mediodorsal thalamus, dorsal raphe, and deep mesencephalic nuclei, and sparse projections go to prefrontal cortical regions and to nucleus accumbens shell and core. These projections differ from the major VTA DA target regions. Retrograde tracing studies confirmed results from the anterograde experiments and differences in projections from VTA subnuclei. Retrogradely labeled GABA neurons were not numerous, and most non-tyrosine hydroxylase/retrogradely labeled cells lacked GABAergic markers. Many non-TH/retrogradely labeled cells projecting to several areas expressed VGluT2. VTA GABA and glutamate neurons project throughout the brain, most prominently to regions with reciprocal connections to the VTA. These data indicate that VTA GABA and glutamate neurons may have more DA-independent functions than previously recognized. J. Comp.

 To evaluate the efficacy of DHEA as a monotherapy treatment for midlife-onset depression.Design~ 
 A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover treatment study was performed from January 4, 1996, through August 31, 2002.Settings~ 
 The National Institute of Mental Health Midlife Outpatient Clinic in the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Md.Patients~ 
 Men (n~=~23) and women (n~=~23) aged 45 to 65 years with midlife-onset major or minor depression participated in this study. None of the subjects received concurrent antidepressant medications.Intervention~ 
 Six weeks of DHEA therapy, 90 mg/d for 3 weeks and 450 mg/d for 3 weeks, and 6 weeks of placebo.Main Outcome Measures~ 
 The 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Additional measures included the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning. Results were analyzed by means of repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni t tests.Results~ 
 Six weeks of DHEA administration was associated with a significant improvement in the 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ratings compared with both baseline (P\ensuremath{<}.01) and 6 weeks of placebo treatment (P\ensuremath{<}.01). A 50\% or greater reduction in baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores was observed in 23 subjects after DHEA and in 13 subjects after placebo treatments. Six weeks of DHEA treatment also was associated with significant improvements in Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning scores relative to baseline and placebo conditions.Conclusion~ 
 We find DHEA to be an effective treatment for midlife-onset major and minor depression.},

To determine accuracy, we compared logistic regression results to a geriatrician's diagnosis of MCI or dementia that included Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or mixed dementia.

Whereas the analysis is limited by small sample sizes and mixing of diverse pathologies, the findings do provide support that the subgroups may share changes in neuropsychological, cardiovascular, and electroencephalographic factors (specifically ADAS-Cog total score, cardiovascular history, and EEG complexity). Taken together, the study results provide support that EEG might complement the clinician's evaluation of dementia and MCI.},

In the current study we relate the long receptive fields that are characteristic of layer 6 cells to the input that these cells receive from layer 5. The axons of layer 5 pyramidal cells project over long distances within layer 6, enabling layer 6 cells to collect input from regions of cortex representing large parts of the visual field. When layer 5 was locally inactivated by injection of the inhibitory transmitter GABA, layer 6 cells lost sensitivity over the portion of their receptive fields corresponding to the inactivated region of layer 5. This suggests that the extensive convergence in the projection from layer 5 to layer 6 is responsible for generating the long receptive fields characteristic of the layer 6 cells.},

Here, we use a c-fos-based genetic tagging system to selectively express the channelrhodopsin variant, ChEF, and optogenetically reactivate a specific neural ensemble in retrosplenial cortex (RSC) engaged by context fear conditioning. Artificial stimulation of RSC was sufficient to produce both context-specific behavior and downstream cellular activity commensurate with natural experience. Moreover, optogenetically but not contextually elicited responses were insensitive to hippocampal inactivation, suggesting that although the hippocampus is needed to coordinate activation by sensory cues, a higher-order cortical framework can independently subserve learned behavior, even shortly after learning.},

Two networks were involved in retaining increasing loads of verbal information in working memory. Network utilizations were used to test associations between function and indices of grey matter volume changes using voxel based morphometry. Global changes in brain volume were not associated with the secondary network. Lower regional grey matter volume in the left pre-central gyrus within the primary network was associated with increased secondary network utilization independent of age group. Decreased regional grey matter volume was associated with increased age only in the elders. Increased secondary network expression was associated with increased slope of reaction times across memory load, in the elders. These results support the theory of neural compensation, that elder participants recruit additional neural resources to maintain task performance in the face of age-related decreases in regional grey matter volume.},

In a simple global integration model, inputs from all locations sum in the axon. In a two-stage integration model, inputs contribute directly to dendritic spikes, and outputs from multiple branches sum in the axon. These two models yield opposite predictions of how synapses at different dendritic locations should be scaled if they are to contribute equally to neuronal output. We used serial-section electron microscopy to reconstruct individual apical oblique dendritic branches of CA1 pyramidal neurons and observe a synapse distribution consistent with the two-stage integration model. Computational modeling suggests that the observed synapse distribution enhances the contribution of each dendritic branch to neuronal output.},

  abstract = {The effects of aging were traditionally thought to be immutable, particularly evident in the loss of plasticity and cognitive abilities occurring in the aged central nervous system (CNS). However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that extrinsic systemic manipulations such as exercise, caloric restriction, and changing blood composition by heterochronic parabiosis or young plasma administration can partially counteract this age-related loss of plasticity in the aged brain. In this review, we discuss the process of aging and rejuvenation as systemic events. We summarize genetic studies that demonstrate a surprising level of malleability in organismal lifespan, and highlight the potential for systemic manipulations to functionally reverse the effects of aging in the CNS. Based on mounting evidence, we propose that rejuvenating effects of systemic manipulations are mediated, in part, by blood-borne 'pro-youthful' factors. Thus, systemic manipulations promoting a younger blood composition provide effective strategies to rejuvenate the aged brain. As a consequence, we can now consider reactivating latent plasticity dormant in the aged CNS as a means to rejuvenate regenerative, synaptic, and cognitive functions late in life, with potential implications even for extending lifespan. We review evidence of brain rejuvenation focusing on several systemic manipulations - exercise, caloric restriction, heterochronic parabiosis, and young plasma administration - and their ability to restore regenerative capacity, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function in the brain.},

  abstract = {The polyamines spermidine, spermine, and their precursor putrescine are essential for cell growth and the regulation of the cell cycle. Recent studies suggest that excessive accumulation of polyamines favors either malignant transformation or apoptosis, depending on the cell type and the stimulus. This study examines the involvement of polyamines in the induction of apoptosis by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. In IEC-6 cells, camptothecin induced apoptosis within 6 h, accompanied by detachment of cells. Detached cells showed DNA laddering and caspase 3 induction, characteristic features of apoptosis. Depletion of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine by DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) that is the first rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, decreased the apoptotic index. Delayed apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in caspase 3 activity in polyamine-depleted cells. Addition of putrescine restored the induction of apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the number of detached cells and caspase 3 activity. Polyamine depletion did not change the level of caspase 3 protein. Inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by a specific inhibitor [diethylglyoxal bis-(guanylhydrazone); DEGBG] led to depletion of spermidine and spermine with a significant accumulation of putrescine and induction of ODC. The DEGBG-treated cells showed an increase in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of putrescine in the apoptotic process. Addition of putrescine to DFMO-treated cell extracts did not increase caspase 3 activity. The above results indicate that polyamine depletion delays the onset of apoptosis in IEC-6 cells and confers protection against DNA damaging agents, suggesting that polyamines might be involved in the caspase activating signal cascade.},

According to different studies, between 5\% and 10\% of people suffer a single isolated seizure episode at some time in their life. However, little is known about the effects of a single seizure episode on cognitive function, and clinical investigations of this issue are not easy to perform. In this situation, animal models may be a reasonable choice. The aim of our study was to follow the time course of delayed effects of generalized clonic-tonic convulsions on learning and memory functions in rats. A clonic-tonic seizure episode was induced by a single i.p. injection of pentylenetetrazole (70 mg/kg). Different behavioral tests were performed between days 10 and 100 after the convulsant administration. A single seizure episode resulted in a gradual decline in short-term memory function as assessed by novel object recognition and social recognition tests. The seizure episode induced a quick increase in hippocampal cell proliferation; however, the excessive newly generated cells seemed to be eliminated by the time of obvious cognitive impairment. These observations are indicative of a slowly developing and long-lasting influence of a single seizure episode on cognitive function. A rather long time period between the seizure episode and the manifestations of cognitive decline provides a window for a possible therapeutic intervention, and an elaboration of such ``post-conditioning'' treatments may be a promising opportunity to prevent subsequent mental impairments in patients.},

  abstract = {Enlargement of dendritic spines and synapses correlates with enhanced synaptic strength during long-term potentiation (LTP), especially in immature hippocampal neurons. Less clear is the nature of this structural synaptic plasticity on mature hippocampal neurons, and nothing is known about the structural plasticity of inhibitory synapses during LTP. Here the timing and extent of structural synaptic plasticity and changes in local protein synthesis evidenced by polyribosomes were systematically evaluated at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses on CA1 dendrites from mature rats following induction of LTP with theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Recent work suggests dendritic segments can act as functional units of plasticity. To test whether structural synaptic plasticity is similarly coordinated, we reconstructed from serial section transmission electron microscopy all of the spines and synapses along representative dendritic segments receiving control stimulation or TBS-LTP. At 5 min after TBS, polyribosomes were elevated in large spines suggesting an initial burst of local protein synthesis, and by 2 h only those spines with further enlarged synapses contained polyribosomes. Rapid induction of synaptogenesis was evidenced by an elevation in asymmetric shaft synapses and stubby spines at 5 min and more nonsynaptic filopodia at 30 min. By 2 h, the smallest synaptic spines were markedly reduced in number. This synapse loss was perfectly counterbalanced by enlargement of the remaining excitatory synapses such that the summed synaptic surface area per length of dendritic segment was constant across time and conditions. Remarkably, the inhibitory synapses showed a parallel synaptic plasticity, also demonstrating a decrease in number perfectly counterbalanced by an increase in synaptic surface area. Thus, TBS-LTP triggered spinogenesis followed by loss of small excitatory and inhibitory synapses and a subsequent enlargement of the remaining synapses by 2 h. These data suggest that dendritic segments coordinate structural plasticity across multiple synapses and maintain a homeostatic balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs through local protein-synthesis and selective capture or redistribution of dendritic resources.},

This review discusses how the glutamatergic system is impaired in Alzheimer disease and how interactions of amyloid \ss{} and glutamate influence synaptic function, tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, glutamate not only influences amyloid \ss{} production, but also amyloid \ss{} can alter the levels of glutamate at the synapse, indicating that small changes in the concentrations of both molecules could influence Alzheimer disease progression. Finally, we describe how the glutamate receptor antagonist, memantine, has been used in the treatment of individuals with Alzheimer disease and discuss its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is a critical component of the neural circuit regulating fear learning. During fear learning and recall, the amygdala and other brain regions, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, exhibit phase-locked oscillations in the high delta/low theta frequency band (\ensuremath{\sim}2\textendash{}6 Hz) that have been shown to contribute to the learning process. Network oscillations are commonly generated by inhibitory synaptic input that coordinates action potentials in groups of neurons. In the rat BLA, principal neurons spontaneously receive synchronized, inhibitory input in the form of compound, rhythmic, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), likely originating from burst-firing parvalbumin interneurons. Here we investigated the role of compound IPSPs in the rat and rhesus macaque BLA in regulating action potential synchrony and spike-timing precision. Furthermore, because principal neurons exhibit intrinsic oscillatory properties and resonance between 4 and 5 Hz, in the same frequency band observed during fear, we investigated whether compound IPSPs and intrinsic oscillations interact to promote rhythmic activity in the BLA at this frequency. Using whole-cell patch clamp in brain slices, we demonstrate that compound IPSPs, which occur spontaneously and are synchronized across principal neurons in both the rat and primate BLA, significantly improve spike-timing precision in BLA principal neurons for a window of \ensuremath{\sim}300 ms following each IPSP. We also show that compound IPSPs coordinate the firing of pairs of BLA principal neurons, and significantly improve spike synchrony for a window of \ensuremath{\sim}130 ms. Compound IPSPs enhance a 5 Hz calcium-dependent membrane potential oscillation (MPO) in these neurons, likely contributing to the improvement in spike-timing precision and synchronization of spiking. Activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling cascade enhanced the MPO, and inhibition of this cascade blocked the MPO. We discuss these results in the context of spike-timing dependent plasticity and modulation by neurotransmitters important for fear learning, such as dopamine.},

However, there are no direct links between LA and CeM. As the main target of LA and with its strong projection to CeM, the basomedial amygdala (BM) constitutes a good candidate to bridge this gap. Consistent with this notion, it was reported that combined posttraining lesions of the basal nuclei [BM plus basolateral nucleus (BL)] abolish conditioned fear responses, whereas selective BL inactivation does not. Thus, we examined the relative contribution of BM and BL to conditioned fear using unit recordings and inactivation with muscimol microinfusions in rats. Approximately 30\% of BM and BL neurons acquired robust responses to auditory CSs predicting footshocks. While most BL cells stopped firing at CS offset, BM responses typically outlasted the CS by \ensuremath{\geq}40 s, paralleling the persistence of conditioned fear after the CS. This observation suggests that BM neurons are not passive relays of rapidly adapting LA inputs about the CS. Surprisingly, independent inactivation of either BM or BL with muscimol did not cause a reduction of conditioned freezing even though an extinction recall deficit was seen the next day. In contrast, combined BL\textendash{}BM inactivation did. Overall, there results support the notion that the basal nuclei are involved in conditioned fear expression and extinction but that there is functional redundancy between them.},

Spinning disk confocal microscopy and high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction revealed extensive internalization of A\ensuremath{\beta} into the lysosomes of activated microglia in mouse brains subjected to SUS, with no concomitant increase observed in the number of microglia. Plaque burden was reduced in SUS-treated AD mice compared to sham-treated animals, and cleared plaques were observed in 75\% of SUS-treated mice. Treated AD mice also displayed improved performance on three memory tasks: the Y-maze, the novel object recognition test, and the active place avoidance task.

  abstract = {Natural scene coding in ferret visual cortex was investigated using a new technique for multi-site recording of neuronal activity from the cortical surface. Surface recordings accurately reflected radially aligned layer 2/3 activity. At individual sites, evoked activity to natural scenes was weakly correlated with the local image contrast structure falling within the cells' classical receptive field. However, a population code, derived from activity integrated across cortical sites having retinotopically overlapping receptive fields, correlated strongly with the local image contrast structure. Cell responses demonstrated high lifetime sparseness, population sparseness, and high dispersal values, implying efficient neural coding in terms of information processing. These results indicate that while cells at an individual cortical site do not provide a reliable estimate of the local contrast structure in natural scenes, cell activity integrated across distributed cortical sites is closely related to this structure in the form of a sparse and dispersed code.},

Here we describe the use of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) for tracing neuronal connections in vivo. We made VSV vectors that used glycoprotein (G) genes from several other viruses. The G protein from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus endowed VSV with the ability to spread transsynaptically, specifically in an anterograde direction, whereas the rabies virus glycoprotein gave a specifically retrograde transsynaptic pattern. The use of an avian G protein fusion allowed specific targeting of cells expressing an avian receptor, which allowed a demonstration of monosynaptic anterograde tracing from defined cells. Synaptic connectivity of pairs of virally labeled cells was demonstrated by using slice cultures and electrophysiology. In vivo infections of several areas in the mouse brain led to the predicted patterns of spread for anterograde or retrograde tracers.},

To determine whether this pathology may be associated with amyloid burden, the present study used the Golgi stain technique to assess age- and genotype-dependent changes in dendritic spine density in CA1 hippocampus of two transgenic mouse lines that produce high levels of Abeta. Tg2576 and PDAPP mice, as well as a group of Tg2576 mice crossed with human apoE2-expressing transgenic mice, were compared to respective transgene-negative controls. Since the time course of amyloid plaque deposition in the PDAPP and Tg2576 mice is well characterized, we examined changes in spine density at ages that corresponded to different levels of amyloid plaque load. The data show age- and genotype-dependent reductions in spine density in both Tg2576 and PDAPP mice, albeit at somewhat different time courses. The spine loss occurred prior to plaque deposition and was ameliorated by the overexpression of human apoE2. These results suggest that a soluble Abeta species may affect hippocampal synapses and thereby contribute to functional deficits evident in these animals.},

An increase in preference for the drug-associated compartment is observed after a single exposure. Establishment of this high-throughput protocol in zebrafish makes it possible to investigate the molecular and cellular basis of choice behavior, reward and associative learning.

The primary outcome was the Useful Field of View (UFOV) test, and the secondary outcomes were the Trail Making (Trails) A and B Tests, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Stroop Color and Word Tests, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and the Digit Vigilance Test (DVT), which were assessed at baseline and at one year. 620 participants (91\%) completed the study and were included in the analyses.

The ventral bank (dorsolateral entorhinal cortex) projected to the lateral entorhinal cortex, dorsal subiculum, and subfield CA1 and mainly targeted the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. Corticocortical projections from the dorsal and ventral banks targeted different cortical areas. The fundus of the rhinal sulcus (area 35) projected to both lateral and medial entorhinal cortices, ventral subiculum, lateral and basolateral nuclei, and amygdalostriatal transition zone. Corticocortical projections targeted areas projected to by both dorsal and ventral banks and also by second somatosensory area, first temporal cortical area, and striate cortex. Neurons projecting to the lateral nucleus were distributed in all layers of the dorsal bank, wheras those projecting to CA1 and subiculum were found in superfical layers (mostly layer III) of the ventral bank. Projections to the basolateral nucleus arose from superfical layers (mostly layer II) of the fundus and deep layers of the ventral bank. Furthermore, projections to the amygdala mostly arose from rostral levels, whereas hippocampal projections primarily originated caudally. The rat perirhinal cortex is heterogeneous in its efferent connectivity, and distinct projections arise from the dorsal and ventral banks and fundus of the rhinal sulcus. The widespread cortical connectivity of the fundus suggests that only this part of the perirhinal cortex is similar to area 35 of the primate brain.},

METHOD: Twenty-two patients with major depression, either medication-free or on stabilized antidepressant regimens, received either DHEA (maximum dose = 90 mg/day) or placebo for 6 weeks in a double-blind manner and were rated at baseline and at the end of the 6 weeks with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Patients previously stabilized with antidepressants had the study medication added to that regimen; others received DHEA or placebo alone.
RESULTS: DHEA was associated with a significantly greater decrease in Hamilton depression scale ratings than was placebo. Five of the 11 patients treated with DHEA, compared with none of the 11 given placebo, showed a 50\% decrease or greater in depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DHEA treatment may have significant antidepressant effects in some patients with major depression. Further, larger-scale trials are warranted.},

Strikingly, the number of model PNs integrated into the fear memory trace remained constant despite the much larger range considered, and model runs highlighted several conditioning-induced tone responsive characteristics of the various PN populations. Furthermore, these studies showed that although excitation was important, disynaptic inhibition among PNs is the dominant mechanism that keeps the number of plastic PNs stable despite large variations in the network's excitability. Finally, we found that the overall level of inhibition in the model network determines the number of projection cells integrated into the fear memory trace.},

  abstract = {Neurons may compete against one another for integration into a memory trace. Specifically, neurons in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala with relatively higher levels of cAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein (CREB) seem to be preferentially allocated to a fear memory trace, while neurons with relatively decreased CREB function seem to be excluded from a fear memory trace. CREB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that modulates many diverse cellular processes, raising the question as to which of these CREB-mediated processes underlie memory allocation. CREB is implicated in modulating dendritic spine number and morphology. As dendritic spines are intimately involved in memory formation, we investigated whether manipulations of CREB function alter spine number or morphology of neurons at the time of fear conditioning. We used viral vectors to manipulate CREB function in the lateral amygdala (LA) principal neurons in mice maintained in their homecages. At the time that fear conditioning normally occurs, we observed that neurons with high levels of CREB had more dendritic spines, while neurons with low CREB function had relatively fewer spines compared to control neurons. These results suggest that the modulation of spine density provides a potential mechanism for preferential allocation of a subset of neurons to the memory trace.},

Furthermore, memory was reduced if AMPA receptor synaptic incorporation was blocked in as few as 10 to 20\% of lateral amygdala neurons. Thus, the encoding of memories in the lateral amygdala is mediated by AMPA receptor trafficking, is widely distributed, and displays little redundancy.},

  abstract = {The Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM) computational model, which incorporates a metaplastic sliding threshold for LTP induction, accounts well for experience-dependent changes in synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. BCM-like metaplasticity over a shorter timescale has also been observed in the hippocampus, thus providing a tractable experimental preparation for testing specific predictions of the model. Here, using extracellular and intracellular electrophysiological recordings from acute rat hippocampal slices, we tested the critical BCM predictions (1) that high levels of synaptic activation will induce a metaplastic state that spreads across dendritic compartments, and (2) that postsynaptic cell-firing is the critical trigger for inducing that state. In support of the first premise, high-frequency priming stimulation inhibited subsequent long-term potentiation and facilitated subsequent long-term depression at synapses quiescent during priming, including those located in a dendritic compartment different to that of the primed pathway. These effects were not dependent on changes in synaptic inhibition or NMDA/metabotropic glutamate receptor function. However, in contrast to the BCM prediction, somatic action potentials during priming were neither necessary nor sufficient to induce the metaplasticity effect. Instead, in broad agreement with derivatives of the BCM model, calcium as released from intracellular stores and triggered by M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation was critical for altering subsequent synaptic plasticity. These results indicate that synaptic plasticity in stratum radiatum of CA1 can be homeostatically regulated by the cell-wide history of synaptic activity through a calcium-dependent but action potential-independent mechanism.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have documented the normal age-related decline of neural structure, function, and cognitive performance. Preliminary evidence suggests that meditation may reduce decline in specific cognitive domains and in brain structure. Here we extended this research by investigating the relation between age and fluid intelligence and resting state brain functional network architecture using graph theory, in middle-aged yoga and meditation practitioners, and matched controls. Fluid intelligence declined slower in yoga practitioners and meditators combined than in controls. Resting state functional networks of yoga practitioners and meditators combined were more integrated and more resilient to damage than those of controls. Furthermore, mindfulness was positively correlated with fluid intelligence, resilience, and global network efficiency. These findings reveal the possibility to increase resilience and to slow the decline of fluid intelligence and brain functional architecture and suggest that mindfulness plays a mechanistic role in this preservation.},

It appears unlikely that there are only one or two cognate receptors for neurotoxic forms of A\ensuremath{\beta} and also that there are just one or two assembly forms of the peptide that induce neuronal dysfunction. Rather, various soluble (diffusible) oligomers of A\ensuremath{\beta} that may be in dynamic equilibrium with insoluble, fibrillar deposits (amyloid plaques) and that can bind to different components of neuronal and non-neuronal plasma membranes appear to induce complex patterns of synaptic dysfunction and network disorganization that underlie the intermittent but gradually progressive cognitive manifestations of the clinical disorder. Modern analyses of this problem utilize electrophysiology coupled with synaptic biochemistry and behavioral phenotyping of animal models to elucidate the affected circuits and assess the effects of potential therapeutic interventions.},

These activation and reactivation processes have been called \&\#x201c;conjunctive trace.\&\#x201d; This process implies that singular molecular events must occur during acquisition, strengthening the connection between the implicated cells whose synchronous activity must underlie subsequent reactivations. The strongest experimental support for the conjunctive trace model comes from the study of immediate early genes such as c-fos, zif268, and activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein. The expressions of these genes are reliably induced by behaviorally relevant neuronal activity and their products often play a central role in long-term memory formation. In this review, we propose that the peculiar characteristics of Arc protein, such as its optimal expression after ongoing experience or familiar behavior, together with its versatile and central functions in synaptic plasticity could explain how familiarization and recognition memories are stored and preserved in the mammalian brain.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by the accumulation of amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} (A\ensuremath{\beta}), which induces progressive decline in learning, memory, and other cognitive functions. A\ensuremath{\beta} is a neurotoxic protein that disrupts calcium signaling in neurons and alters synaptic plasticity. These effects lead to loss of synapses, neural network dysfunction, and inactivation of neuronal signaling. However, the precise mechanism by which A\ensuremath{\beta} causes neurodegeneration is still not clear, despite decades of intensive research. The role of astrocytes in early cognitive decline is a major component of disease pathology that has been poorly understood. Recent research suggests that astrocytes are not simply passive support cells for neurons, but are active participants in neural information processing in the brain. A\ensuremath{\beta} can disrupt astrocytic calcium signaling and gliotransmitter release, processes that are vital for astrocyte-neuron communication. Therefore, astrocyte dysfunction may contribute to the earliest neuronal deficits in AD. Here we discuss emerging concepts in glial biology and the implications of astrocyte dysfunction on neurodegeneration in AD.},

Here we report that, in rats repeatedly exposed to two differently shaped environments, the hippocampal-place-cell representations of those environments gradually and incrementally diverge; this divergence is specific to environmental shape, occurs independently of explicit reward, persists for periods of at least one month, and transfers to new enclosures of the same shape.

Typically, these molecules are 50-200 nucleotides in size and do not contain expressed open reading frames (ORFs). In Escherichia coli, about 70 members of this group have been identified to date and further estimates assume hundreds of sRNAs per bacterial genome. Regulation of gene expression by sRNAs is predominantly mediated by physical sRNA/target mRNA interactions that are based on short and imperfect complementarity. Although the contribution of sRNAs to overall bacterial gene regulation is now being appreciated, the function of many sRNAs is still unknown and their targets await to be uncovered. We recently developed a modular two-plasmid system, based on the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as non-invasive reporter of gene expression, to rapidly monitor the regulatory potential of sRNA/target mRNA pairs under investigation in vivo. The specialized reporter plasmid series also provides a suitable platform to study the function of cis-encoded riboregulators such as natural riboswitches, thermosensors, or engineered aptamer-based regulatory switches.},

  abstract = {Environmental factors substantially influence beginning and progression of mental illness, reinforcing or reducing the consequences of genetic vulnerability. Often initiated by early traumatic events, ``engrams'' or memories are formed that may give rise to a slow and subtle progression of psychiatric disorders. The large delay between beginning and time of onset (diagnosis) may be explained by efficient compensatory mechanisms observed in brain metabolism that use optional pathways in highly redundant molecular interactions. To this end, research has to deal with mechanisms of learning and long-term memory formation, which involves (a) epigenetic changes, (b) altered neuronal activities, and (c) changes in neuron-glia communication. On the epigenetic level, apparently DNA-methylations are more stable than histone modifications, although both closely interact. Neuronal activities basically deliver digital information, which clearly can serve as basis for memory formation (LTP). However, research in this respect has long time neglected the importance of glia. They are more actively involved in the control of neuronal activities than thought before. They can both reinforce and inhibit neuronal activities by transducing neuronal information from frequency-encoded to amplitude and frequency-modulated calcium wave patterns spreading in the glial syncytium by use of gap junctions. In this way, they serve integrative functions. In conclusion, we are dealing with two concepts of encoding information that mutually control each other and synergize: a digital (neuronal) and a wave-like (glial) computing, forming neuron-glia functional units with inbuilt feedback loops to maintain balance of excitation and inhibition. To better understand mental illness, we have to gain more insight into the dynamics of adverse environmental impact on those cellular and molecular systems. This report summarizes existing knowledge and draws some outline about further research in molecular psychiatry.},

Data were collected from participants undergoing 3 months of intensive meditation training in an isolated retreat setting (Retreat 1) and a wait-list control group that later underwent identical training (Retreat 2). A 32-min response inhibition task (RIT) was designed to assess sustained self-regulatory control. Adaptive functioning (AF) was operationalized as a single latent factor underlying self-report measures of anxious and avoidant attachment, mindfulness, ego resilience, empathy, the five major personality traits (extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience), difficulties in emotion regulation, depression, anxiety, and psychological well-being. Participants in Retreat 1 improved in RIT performance and AF over time whereas the controls did not. The control participants later also improved on both dimensions during their own retreat (Retreat 2). These improved levels of RIT performance and AF were sustained in follow-up assessments conducted approximately 5 months after the training. Longitudinal dynamic models with combined data from both retreats showed that improvement in RIT performance during training influenced the change in AF over time, which is consistent with a key claim in the Buddhist literature that enhanced capacity for self-regulation is an important precursor of changes in emotional well-being.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0068131},
  abstract = {Olfactory-discrimination learning was shown to induce a profound long-lasting enhancement in the strength of excitatory and inhibitory synapses of pyramidal neurons in the piriform cortex. Notably, such enhancement was mostly pronounced in a sub-group of neurons, entailing about a quarter of the cell population. Here we first show that the prominent enhancement in the subset of cells is due to a process in which all excitatory synapses doubled their strength and that this increase was mediated by a single process in which the AMPA channel conductance was doubled. Moreover, using a neuronal-network model, we show how such a multiplicative whole-cell synaptic strengthening in a sub-group of cells that form a memory pattern, sub-serves a profound selective enhancement of this memory. Network modeling further predicts that synaptic inhibition should be modified by complex learning in a manner that much resembles synaptic excitation. Indeed, in a subset of neurons all GABAA-receptors mediated inhibitory synapses also doubled their strength after learning. Like synaptic excitation, Synaptic inhibition is also enhanced by two-fold increase of the single channel conductance. These findings suggest that crucial learning induces a multiplicative increase in strength of all excitatory and inhibitory synapses in a subset of cells, and that such an increase can serve as a long-term whole-cell mechanism to profoundly enhance an existing Hebbian-type memory. This mechanism does not act as synaptic plasticity mechanism that underlies memory formation but rather enhances the response of already existing memory. This mechanism is cell-specific rather than synapse-specific; it modifies the channel conductance rather than the number of channels and thus has the potential to be readily induced and un-induced by whole-cell transduction mechanisms.},

The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin contribute to the processing of social cues necessary for individual recognition. Mesolimbic dopamine is involved in reinforcement and reward learning. Concurrent activation of neuropeptide and dopamine receptors in the reward centers of the brain during mating results in a conditioned partner preference, observed as a pair bond. Differential regulation of neuropeptide receptor expression may explain species differences in the ability to form pair bonds. These and other studies discussed here have intriguing implications for the neurobiology of social attachment in our own species.},

  abstract = {After fear conditioning, presenting the conditioned stimulus (CS) alone yields a context-specific extinction memory; fear is suppressed in the extinction context, but renews in any other context. The context-dependence of extinction is mediated by a brain circuit consisting of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala. In the present work, we sought to determine at what level of this circuit context-dependent representations of the CS emerge. To explore this question, we used cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescent in situ hybridization (catFISH). This method exploits the intracellular expression profile of the immediate early gene (IEG), Arc, to visualize neuronal activation patterns to two different behavioral experiences. Rats were fear conditioned in one context and extinguished in another; 24 h later, they were sequentially exposed to the CS in the extinction context and another context. Control rats were also tested in each context, but were never extinguished. We assessed Arc mRNA expression within the basal amygdala (BA), lateral amygdala (LA), ventral hippocampus (VH), prelimbic cortex (PL) and infralimbic cortex (IL). We observed that the sequential retention tests induced context-dependent patterns of Arc expression in the BA, LA, and IL of extinguished rats; this was not observed in non-extinguished controls. In general, non-extinguished animals had proportionately greater numbers of non-selective (double-labeled) neurons than extinguished animals. Collectively, these findings suggest that extinction learning results in pattern separation, particularly within the BA, in which unique neuronal ensembles represent fear memories after extinction.},

Here we report results from studies that have attempted to confirm the projections from several candidate afferent regions using (3)H-amino acid autoradiography as an anterograde tracer. We have charted, based on the results of 33 separate injections, the topographic distribution of cortical projections throughout the amygdala. Areas TE and TEO of the inferotemporal cortex, portions of the superior temporal gyrus, and the granular region of the insula project primarily to the lateral nucleus, with little or no innervation of other amygdaloid nuclei. In contrast, orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, and anterior cingulate regions project primarily to the basal and accessory basal nuclei and provide little innervation to the lateral nucleus. The orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices, but not the anterior cingulate cortex, project to medially situated amygdaloid areas such as the cortical and medial nuclei and to the periamygdaloid cortex. The agranular and dysgranular insula, the parainsula, and rostral portions of the superior temporal gyrus project both to the lateral, basal, and accessory basal nuclei and to the medially situated nuclei. Projections to the central nucleus are particularly prominent from these regions. These data are discussed in relation to the hierarchical processing of sensory information that occurs within the amygdaloid complex.},

Animal models can exhibit limited but quantifiable behavioural impairments resulting from chronic stress, including deficits in motivation, abnormal responses to behavioural challenges, and anhedonia. The hippocampus is thought to negatively regulate the stress response and to mediate various cognitive and mnemonic aspects of stress-induced impairments, although the neuronal underpinnings sufficient to support behavioural improvements are largely unknown. Here we acutely rescue stress-induced depression-related behaviours in mice by optogenetically reactivating dentate gyrus cells that were previously active during a positive experience. A brain-wide histological investigation, coupled with pharmacological and projection-specific optogenetic blockade experiments, identified glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus-amygdala-nucleus-accumbens pathway as a candidate circuit supporting the acute rescue. Finally, chronically reactivating hippocampal cells associated with a positive memory resulted in the rescue of stress-induced behavioural impairments and neurogenesis at time points beyond the light stimulation. Together, our data suggest that activating positive memories artificially is sufficient to suppress depression-like behaviours and point to dentate gyrus engram cells as potential therapeutic nodes for intervening with maladaptive behavioural states.},

Resting state dynamics increasingly play a role in the assessment of connectivity-based pathologies such as Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. We systematically applied tDCS in a large-scale network model of 74 cerebral areas, investigating the spatiotemporal changes in dynamic states as a function of structural connectivity changes. Structural connectivity was defined by the human connectome. The main findings of this study are fourfold: Firstly, we found a tDCS-induced increase in functional connectivity among cerebral areas and among EEG sensors, where the latter reproduced empirical findings of other researchers. Secondly, the analysis of the network dynamics suggested synchronization to be the main mechanism of the observed effects. Thirdly, we found that tDCS sharpens and shifts the frequency distribution of scalp EEG sensors slightly towards higher frequencies. Fourthly, new dynamic states emerged through interacting areas in the network compared to the dynamics of an isolated area. The findings propose synchronization as a key mechanism underlying the changes in the spatiotemporal pattern formation due to tDCS. Our work supports the notion that noninvasive brain stimulation is able to bias brain dynamics by affecting the competitive interplay of functional subnetworks.},

Much progress has been made in uncovering the neural basis of fear learning through studies in which associative emotional memories are formed by pairing an initially neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS; e. g., a tone) to an unconditioned stimulus (US; e. g., a shock). Despite recent advances, the question of how to persistently weaken aversive CS-US associations, or dampen traumatic memories in pathological cases, remains a major dilemma. Two paradigms (blockade of reconsolidation and extinction) have been used in the laboratory to reduce acquired fear. Unfortunately, their clinical efficacy is limited: Reconsolidation blockade typically requires potentially toxic drugs, and extinction is not permanent. Here, we describe a behavioral design in which a fear memory in rats is destabilized and reinterpreted as safe by presenting an isolated retrieval trial before an extinction session. This procedure permanently attenuates the fear memory without the use of drugs.},

The measures of Abeta deposition, Abeta-immunoreactive plaques with and without cores, thioflavin histofluorescent plaques, and concentrations of insoluble Abeta, failed to distinguish HPC from AD patients and were poor correlates of synaptic change. By contrast, concentrations of soluble Abeta clearly distinguished HPC from AD patients and were a strong inverse correlate of synapse loss. Further investigation revealed that Abeta40, whether in soluble or insoluble form, was a particularly useful measure for classifying ND, HPC, and AD patients compared with Abeta42. Abeta40 is known to be elevated in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, and Abeta40 (but not Abeta42) levels, cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, and ApoE4 allele frequency were all highly correlated with each other. Although paired helical filaments in the form of neurofibrillary tangles or a penumbra of neurites surrounding amyloid cores also distinguished HPC from AD patients, they were less robust predictors of synapse change compared with soluble Abeta, particularly soluble Abeta40. Previous experiments attempting to relate Abeta deposition to the neurodegeneration that underlies AD dementia may have failed because they assayed the classical, visible forms of the molecule, insoluble neuropil plaques, rather than the soluble, unseen forms of the molecule.},

To test the idea that such microbes may affect the development of neural systems that govern the endocrine response to stress, we investigated hypothalamic\textendash{}pituitary\textendash{}adrenal (HPA) reaction to stress by comparing germfree (GF), specific pathogen free (SPF) and gnotobiotic mice. Plasma ACTH and corticosterone elevation in response to restraint stress was substantially higher in GF mice than in SPF mice, but not in response to stimulation with ether. Moreover, GF mice also exhibited reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression levels in the cortex and hippocampus relative to SPF mice. The exaggerated HPA stress response by GF mice was reversed by reconstitution with Bifidobacterium infantis. In contrast, monoassociation with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, but not with its mutant strain devoid of the translocated intimin receptor gene, enhanced the response to stress. Importantly, the enhanced HPA response of GF mice was partly corrected by reconstitution with SPF faeces at an early stage, but not by any reconstitution exerted at a later stage, which therefore indicates that exposure to microbes at an early developmental stage is required for the HPA system to become fully susceptible to inhibitory neural regulation. These results suggest that commensal microbiota can affect the postnatal development of the HPA stress response in mice.},

However, the effect of recurrent, relatively short seizures in young animals on subsequent brain development is not known. To study the consequences of recurrent seizures on the developing brain, we subjected immature rats to a total of 50 flurothyl-induced seizures from postnatal day 11 until day 23. Immunohistochemistry for c-fos was performed to characterize the pattern of neuronal activation following the seizures. Cell counting of dentate granule cells, CA3, CA1, and hilar neurons, using unbiased stereological methods, and the silver impregnation method were used to evaluate neuronal death following the recurrent seizures. Timm and Golgi staining were performed four weeks after the 50th seizure to evaluate the effects of recurrent seizures on synaptic organization. Our results show that recurrent flurothyl-induced seizures progressively increased excitability of the brain, as revealed by a dramatic increase in the extent and intensity of c-fos immunostaining. While no cell loss was detected in the hippocampus with either Cresyl Violet or silver stains, animals experiencing multiple daily seizures developed increased mossy fiber sprouting in both the supragranular layer of the dentate gyrus and the infrapyramidale layer of the CA3 region. Golgi staining confirmed that there was an increase in mossy fibers in the pyramidal cell layer. Our results suggest that serial recurrent seizures in the immature brain can lead to significant changes in mossy fiber distribution even though the seizures do not cause significant hippocampal cell loss.},

  abstract = {Recently, transplantation of adult stem cells over embryonic stem cells increased in regenerative medicine. Among the adult stem cells, human endometrium stromal (hEnS) cells are under the strict control of the steroid hormones and have the potential to differentiate into other cell lineages including neural cells. Unfortunately these cells may lose their neurogenic differentiation ability upon extended expansion in cultures. To avoid the back-differentiation, it is important to establish growth conditions that support the rapid proliferation and stable differentiation of hEnS cells over extended periods of time without compromising their neuronal phenotype. Differentiation of transplanted cells is strongly influenced by environmental signals. The steroidal microenvironment of the stem cells plays a major role in controlling neurogenesis in the cultures. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administration to the cultures could support this propose. DHEA enhance survival rates of dissociated neurons in cultures. It can activate AKT protein kinase pathway as well as nerve growth factor (NGF) that enhances neurogenesis efficiently. On the other hand it seems that DHEA increase survival rate of neural cells via production of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), indirectly. BDNF is a mediator product of the DHEA that promotes the differentiation and survival of neurons. Here, we offer that DHEA is a suitable candidate that could provide a microenvironment to stimulate neurogenesis and enhanced survival of newly formed neurons derived from hEnS cells. From the point that DHEA is the most abundant steroid in the body, marketed as a supplement and is increasingly self-prescription we hypothesized that it could be the safe and high available choice. This provides a better insight into the maintenance of neural cells for treatment of a wide variety of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by non-invasively autologous cell therapy by hEnS cells especially in women.},

  abstract = {Behavioural states in mammals, such as the anxious state, are characterized by several features that are coordinately regulated by diverse nervous system outputs, ranging from behavioural choice patterns to changes in physiology (in anxiety, exemplified respectively by risk-avoidance and respiratory rate alterations). Here we investigate if and how defined neural projections arising from a single coordinating brain region in mice could mediate diverse features of anxiety. Integrating behavioural assays, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, respiratory physiology and optogenetics, we identify a surprising new role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the coordinated modulation of diverse anxiety features. First, two BNST subregions were unexpectedly found to exert opposite effects on the anxious state: oval BNST activity promoted several independent anxious state features, whereas anterodorsal BNST-associated activity exerted anxiolytic influence for the same features. Notably, we found that three distinct anterodorsal BNST efferent projections-to the lateral hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus and ventral tegmental area-each implemented an independent feature of anxiolysis: reduced risk-avoidance, reduced respiratory rate, and increased positive valence, respectively. Furthermore, selective inhibition of corresponding circuit elements in freely moving mice showed opposing behavioural effects compared with excitation, and in vivo recordings during free behaviour showed native spiking patterns in anterodorsal BNST neurons that differentiated safe and anxiogenic environments. These results demonstrate that distinct BNST subregions exert opposite effects in modulating anxiety, establish separable anxiolytic roles for different anterodorsal BNST projections, and illustrate circuit mechanisms underlying selection of features for the assembly of the anxious state.},

We here found that sigma-1 receptor stimulation by DHEA improves cognitive function through phosphorylation of synaptic proteins in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mouse hippocampus. We have previously reported that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were impaired in OBX mouse hippocampus. OBX mice were administered once a day for 7-8 days with DHEA (30 or 60 mg/kg p.o.) 10 days after operation. The spatial, cognitive and conditioned fear memories in OBX mice were significantly improved as assessed by Y-maze, novel object recognition and passive avoidance task, respectively. DHEA also improved impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation in OBX mice. Notably, DHEA treatment restored PKC\ensuremath{\alpha} (Ser-657) autophosphorylation and NR1 (Ser-896) and myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (Ser-152/156) phosphorylation to the control levels in the hippocampal CA1 region. Likewise, DHEA treatment improved CaMKII\ensuremath{\alpha} (Thr-286) autophosphorylation and GluR1 (Ser-831) phosphorylation to the control levels in the CA1 region. Furthermore, DHEA treatment improved ERK and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (Ser-133) phosphorylation to the control levels. Finally, NE-100, sigma-1 receptor antagonist, significantly inhibited the DHEA-induced improvement of memory-related behaviors and CaMKII, PKC and ERK phosphorylation in CA1 region. Taken together, sigma-1 receptor stimulation by DHEA ameliorates OBX-induced impairment in memory-related behaviors and long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region through activation of CaMKII, PKC and ERK.},

  doi = {10.3389/fncel.2012.00021},
  abstract = {There is growing realization that the relationship between memory and stress/emotionality is complicated, and may include both memory enhancing and memory impairing aspects. It has been suggested that the underlying mechanisms involve amygdala modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP). We recently reported that while in CA1 basolateral amygdala (BLA) priming impaired theta stimulation induced LTP, it enhanced LTP in the dentate gyrus (DG). However, emotional and stressfull experiences were found to activate synaptic plasticity within the BLA, raising the possibility that BLA modulation of other brain regions may be altered as well, as it may depend on the way the BLA is activated or is responding. In previous studies BLA priming stimulation was relatively weak (1 V, 50 \ensuremath{\mu}s pulse duration). In the present study we assessed the effects of two stronger levels of BLA priming stimulation (1 V or 2 V, 100 \ensuremath{\mu}s pulse duration) on LTP induction in hippocampal DG and CA1, in anesthetized rats. Results show that 1V-BLA priming stimulation enhanced but 2V-BLA priming stimulation impaired DG LTP; however, both levels of BLA priming stimulation impaired CA1 LTP, suggesting that modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by amygdala is dependent on the degree of amygdala activation. These findings suggest that plasticity-induced within the amygdala, by stressful experiences induces a form of metaplasticity that would alter the way the amygdala may modulate memory-related processes in other brain areas, such as the hippocampus.},

Voxel-based morphometry for MRI anatomical brain images and a computerized sustained attention task were employed in 13 regular practitioners of Zen meditation and 13 matched controls. While control subjects displayed the expected negative correlation of both gray matter volume and attentional performance with age, meditators did not show a significant correlation of either measure with age. The effect of meditation on gray matter volume was most prominent in the putamen, a structure strongly implicated in attentional processing. These findings suggest that the regular practice of meditation may have neuroprotective effects and reduce the cognitive decline associated with normal aging.},

Mice received injections of anisomycin after either initial acquisition or retrieval of contextual fear conditioning. When anisomycin injections followed acquisition, freezing was impaired during memory tests the next day and 21 days later. When anisomycin injections followed normal retrieval of contextual fear conditioning, freezing was impaired the next day but recovered to levels of control mice when testing occurred 21 days later. This recovery effect occurred after short or long durations of exposure during the retrieval period and was specific to the conditioning context. These results suggest that anisomycin injections after retrieval do not retroactively affect the memory from conditioning.},

NMDA-sensitive [3H]-glutamate binding, strychnine-insensitive [3H]glycine binding, and [3H]N-(1-[2-thienyl]cyclohexyl)-3,4-piperidine ([3H]TCP) binding were measured to examine the ontogeny of NMDA recognition sites, glycine modulatory sites, and PCP receptors, respectively. NMDA-sensitive [3H]glutamate binding transiently exceeded adult levels by 50 to 120\% in all regions examined, with peak densities generally occurring between postnatal days (PND) 10 and 28. Stratum radiatum CA1 binding increased slowly from 49 to 61\% of the adult value between PND 1 and 7, after which, binding rapidly rose to 151\% of adult values at PND 14, remained elevated through PND 28, and then decreased to adult levels. The ontogenic profile of NMDA recognition site binding was similar in other hippocampal regions, although the initial age of maximal binding and the period of stabilization varied. The ontogenic profiles of glycine modulatory site binding and PCP receptor binding were very similar to each other. Development was delayed, however, with respect to NMDA recognition site binding. The rapid development of binding observed between PND 7 and 14 with NMDA receptors in stratum radiatum CA1 was contrasted by a much slower increase in glycine and PCP receptor binding. Furthermore, maximal glycine and PCP receptor binding densities were not reached until PND 28 and were lower than NMDA recognition site binding densities. The observed developmental patterns of binding to each of the receptor components of the NMDA receptor channel/complex are consistent with postnatal changes in cytoarchitecture, synaptogenesis, afferent lamination, and functional development of the hippocampus. However, the relative overexpression of NMDA recognition sites with respect to glycine and PCP receptors between PND 7 and 21 suggests that there is differential expression of these binding sites during development.},

But why do neurons use spines, when they could accommodate excitatory contacts directly on their dendritic shafts? One suggestion is that spines serve to connect with passing axons, thus increasing the connectivity of the dendrites. Another hypothesis is that spines are biochemical compartments that enable input-specific synaptic plasticity. A third possibility is that spines have an electrical role, filtering synaptic potentials and electrically isolating inputs from each other. In this review, I argue that, when viewed from the perspective of the circuit function, these three functions dovetail with one another to achieve a single overarching goal: to implement a distributed circuit with widespread connectivity. Spines would endow these circuits with nonsaturating, linear integration and input-specific learning rules, which would enable them to function as neural networks, with emergent encoding and processing of information.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Theta burst stimulation, a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, can induce lasting changes in corticospinal excitability that are thought to involve long-term potentiation/depression (LTD/LTD)-like effects on cortical synapses. The pattern of delivery of TBS is crucial in determining the direction of change in synaptic efficiency. Previously we explained this by postulating (1) that a single burst of stimulation induces a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory effects and (2) those effects may cascade to produce long-lasting effects. Here we formalise those ideas into a simple mathematical model.

METHODS

The model is based on a simplified description of the glutamatergic synapse in which post-synaptic Ca(2+) entry initiates processes leading to different amount of potentiation and depression of synaptic transmission. The final effect on the synapse results from summation of the two effects.

RESULTS

The model using these assumptions can fit reported data. Metaplastic effects of voluntary contraction on the response to TBS can be incorporated by changing time constants in the model.

CONCLUSIONS

The pattern-dependent after-effects and interactions with voluntary contraction can be successfully modelled by using reasonable assumptions about known cellular mechanisms of plasticity.

SIGNIFICANCE

The model could provide insight into development of new plasticity induction protocols using TMS.},

  abstract = {Severe childhood epilepsy is commonly associated with intellectual developmental disabilities. The reasons for these cognitive deficits are likely multifactorial and will vary between epilepsy syndromes and even among children with the same syndrome. However, one factor these children have in common is the recurring seizures they experience \textendash{} sometimes on a daily basis. Supporting the idea that the seizures themselves can contribute to intellectual disabilities are laboratory results demonstrating spatial learning and memory deficits in normal mice and rats that have experienced recurrent seizures in infancy. Studies reviewed here have shown that seizures in vivo and electrographic seizure activity in vitro both suppress the growth of hippocampal pyramidal cell dendrites. A simplification of dendritic arborization and a resulting decrease in the number and/or properties of the excitatory synapses on them could help explain the observed cognitive disabilities. There are a wide variety of candidate mechanisms that could be involved in seizure-induced growth suppression. The challenge is designing experiments that will help focus research on a limited number of potential molecular events. Thus far, results suggest that growth suppression is NMDA receptor-dependent and associated with a decrease in activation of the transcription factor CREB. The latter result is intriguing since CREB is known to play an important role in dendrite growth. Seizure-induced dendrite growth suppression may not occur as a single process in which pyramidal cells dendrites simply stop growing or grow slower compared to normal neurons. Instead, recent results suggest that after only a few hours of synchronized epileptiform activity in vitro dendrites appear to partially retract. This acute response is also NMDA receptor dependent and appears to be mediated by the Ca+2/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. An understanding of the staging of seizure-induced growth suppression and the underlying molecular mechanisms will likely prove crucial for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the intellectual developmental disabilities associated with intractable childhood epilepsy.

  abstract = {In humans, weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates excitability in the motor, visual, and prefrontal cortex. Periods rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS) not only facilitate the consolidation of declarative memories, but in humans, SWS is also accompanied by a pronounced endogenous transcortical DC potential shift of negative polarity over frontocortical areas. To experimentally induce widespread extracellular negative DC potentials, we applied anodal tDCS (0.26 mA) [correction] repeatedly (over 30 min) bilaterally at frontocortical electrode sites during a retention period rich in SWS. Retention of declarative memories (word pairs) and also nondeclarative memories (mirror tracing skills) learned previously was tested after this period and compared with retention performance after placebo stimulation as well as after retention intervals of wakefulness. Compared with placebo stimulation, anodal tDCS during SWS-rich sleep distinctly increased the retention of word pairs (p \ensuremath{<} 0.005). When applied during the wake retention interval, tDCS did not affect declarative memory. Procedural memory was also not affected by tDCS. Mood was improved both after tDCS during sleep and during wake intervals. tDCS increased sleep depth toward the end of the stimulation period, whereas the average power in the faster frequency bands (,alpha, and beta) was reduced. Acutely, anodal tDCS increased slow oscillatory activity \ensuremath{<}3 Hz. We conclude that effects of tDCS involve enhanced generation of slow oscillatory EEG activity considered to facilitate processes of neuronal plasticity. Shifts in extracellular ionic concentration in frontocortical tissue (expressed as negative DC potentials during SWS) may facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memories.},

  abstract = {Although the systematic study of meditation is still in its infancy, research has provided evidence for meditation-induced improvements in psychological and physiological well-being. Moreover, meditation practice has been shown not only to benefit higher-order cognitive functions but also to alter brain activity. Nevertheless, little is known about possible links to brain structure. Using high-resolution MRI data of 44 subjects, we set out to examine the underlying anatomical correlates of long-term meditation with different regional specificity (i.e., global, regional, and local). For this purpose, we applied voxel-based morphometry in association with a recently validated automated parcellation approach. We detected significantly larger gray matter volumes in meditators in the right orbito-frontal cortex (as well as in the right thalamus and left inferior temporal gyrus when co-varying for age and/or lowering applied statistical thresholds). In addition, meditators showed significantly larger volumes of the right hippocampus. Both orbito-frontal and hippocampal regions have been implicated in emotional regulation and response control. Thus, larger volumes in these regions might account for meditators' singular abilities and habits to cultivate positive emotions, retain emotional stability, and engage in mindful behavior. We further suggest that these regional alterations in brain structures constitute part of the underlying neurological correlate of long-term meditation independent of a specific style and practice. Future longitudinal analyses are necessary to establish the presence and direction of a causal link between meditation practice and brain anatomy.},

  abstract = {The relative contributions of plasticity in the amygdala vs. its afferent pathways to conditioned fear remain controversial. Some believe that thalamic and cortical neurons transmitting information about the conditioned stimulus (CS) to the lateral amygdala (LA) serve a relay function. Others maintain that thalamic and/or cortical plasticity is critically involved in fear conditioning. To address this question, we developed a large-scale biophysical model of the LA that could reproduce earlier findings regarding the cellular correlates of fear conditioning in LA. We then conducted model experiments that examined whether fear memories depend on (1) training-induced increases in the responsiveness of thalamic and cortical neurons projecting to LA, (2) plasticity at the synapses they form in LA, and/or (3) plasticity at synapses between LA neurons. These tests revealed that training-induced increases in the responsiveness of afferent neurons are required for fear memory formation. However, once the memory has been formed, this factor is no longer required because the efficacy of the synapses that thalamic and cortical neurons form with LA cells has augmented enough to maintain the memory. In contrast, our model experiments suggest that plasticity at synapses between LA neurons plays a minor role in maintaining the fear memory.},

We have studied the transcriptional program that drives this developmental process in Schizosaccharomyces pombe using DNA microarrays. Here we show that hundreds of genes are regulated in successive waves of transcription that correlate with major biological events of meiosis and sporulation. Each wave is associated with specific promoter motifs. Clusters of neighboring genes (mostly close to telomeres) are co-expressed early in the process, which reflects a more global control of these genes. We find that two Atf-like transcription factors are essential for the expression of late genes and formation of spores, and identify dozens of potential Atf target genes. Comparison with the meiotic program of the distantly related Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals an unexpectedly small shared meiotic transcriptome, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of meiosis evolved independently in both species.},

Using virus-mediated gene delivery into a small subset of neurons in a given network, molecular imaging of neuronal activity, pharmacological perturbation of specific neurons' activity and animal behavior assays, recent studies have begun to provide insight into molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the selection of neurons for inclusion into a memory trace. Here, we focus on a review of recent findings supporting the hypothesis that the level of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP/Ca(2+)-response element binding protein) is a key factor governing which neurons are recruited to a given memory trace. These recent findings open a new perspective on memory trace at the neural circuit level and also raise many important questions. Future studies employing more advanced neurobiological techniques for targeting defined populations of neurons and manipulating their activity in time and space in a complex neural network will give answers to these newly emerging questions and extend our understanding of the neurobiological basis of the memory trace.},

However, excessive generalization of such memories, characterized by a failure to discriminate dangerous from safe stimuli, is common in anxiety disorders. Neuronal encoding of the transition from cue-specific to generalized fear is poorly understood. We identified distinct neuronal populations in the lateral amygdala (LA) of rats that signaled generalized versus cue-specific associations and determined how their distributions switched during fear generalization. Notably, the same LA neurons that were cue specific before the behavioral shift to generalized fear lost their specificity afterwards, thereby tilting the balance of activity toward a greater proportion of generalizing neurons. Neuronal activity in the LA, but not the auditory cortex, was necessary for fear generalization. Furthermore, targeted activation of cAMP\textendash{}PKA signaling in the LA increased neuronal excitability of LA neurons and led to generalized fear. These results provide a cellular basis in the amygdala for the alteration of emotional states from normal to pathological fear.},

In vivo techniques such as neuroimaging and cognitive testing offer valuable insights into the effects of APOE genotype on brain structure and function in healthy and clinical populations. We review the evidence from in vivo studies that APOE *E4, in addition to increasing the chance of age-related pathological events, is associated with age-independent non-pathological changes in brain physiology, some of which make the brain less resilient to neurodegenerative processes. We argue that the interaction between the APOE-dependent non-pathological vulnerabilities and age-related pathological changes is one mechanism that can trigger neurodegeneration, resulting in AD and other complex phenotypes.},

  abstract = {The lateral nucleus (LA) is the input station of the amygdala for information about conditioned stimuli (CSs), whereas the medial sector of the central nucleus (CeM) is the output region that contributes most amygdala projections to brainstem fear effectors. However, there are no direct links between LA and CeM. As the main target of LA and with its strong projection to CeM, the basomedial amygdala (BM) constitutes a good candidate to bridge this gap. Consistent with this notion, it was reported that combined posttraining lesions of the basal nuclei [BM plus basolateral nucleus (BL)] abolish conditioned fear responses, whereas selective BL inactivation does not. Thus, we examined the relative contribution of BM and BL to conditioned fear using unit recordings and inactivation with muscimol microinfusions in rats. Approximately 30\% of BM and BL neurons acquired robust responses to auditory CSs predicting footshocks. While most BL cells stopped firing at CS offset, BM responses typically outlasted the CS by \ensuremath{\geq}40 s, paralleling the persistence of conditioned fear after the CS. This observation suggests that BM neurons are not passive relays of rapidly adapting LA inputs about the CS. Surprisingly, independent inactivation of either BM or BL with muscimol did not cause a reduction of conditioned freezing even though an extinction recall deficit was seen the next day. In contrast, combined BL\textendash{}BM inactivation did. Overall, there results support the notion that the basal nuclei are involved in conditioned fear expression and extinction but that there is functional redundancy between them.},

However, there are few studies investigating alterations on glutamate transporters caused by epilepsy in newborn animals, especially in the early periods after seizures. In this study, alterations in the hippocampal glutamate transporters activity and immunocontent were investigated in neonatal rats (7 days old) submitted to kainate-induced seizures model. Glutamate uptake, glutamate transporters (GLT-1, GLAST, EAAC1) and glutamine synthetase (GS) were assessed in hippocampal slices obtained 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 60 days after seizures. Immunoreactivity for hippocampal GFAP, NeuN and DAPI were assessed 24 h after seizure. Behavioral analysis (elevated-plus maze and inhibitory avoidance task) was also investigated in the adult animals (60 days old). The decrease on glutamate uptake was observed in hippocampal slices obtained 24 h after seizures. The immunocontent of GLT-1 increased at 12 h and decreased at 24 h (+62\% and -20\%, respectively), while GLAST increased up to 48 h after seizures. No alterations were observed for EAAC1 and GS. It should be mentioned that there were no long-term changes in tested glutamate transporters at 60 days after kainate treatment. GFAP immunoreactivity increased in all hippocampal subfields (CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus) with no alterations in NeuN and DAPI staining. In the adulthood, kainate-treated rats showed anxiety-related behavior and lower performance in the inhibitory avoidance task. Our findings indicate that acute modifications on hippocampal glutamate transporters triggered by a single convulsive event in early life may play a role in the behavioral alterations observed in adulthood.},

  abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is fundamental to the neural processes underlying learning and memory. Interestingly, synaptic plasticity itself can be dynamically regulated by prior activity, in a process termed 'metaplasticity', which can be expressed both homosynaptically and heterosynaptically. Here, we focus on heterosynaptic metaplasticity, particularly long-range interactions between synapses spread across dendritic compartments, and review evidence for intracellular versus intercellular signalling pathways leading to this effect. Of particular interest is our previously reported finding that priming stimulation in stratum oriens of area CA1 in the hippocampal slice heterosynaptically inhibits subsequent long-term potentiation and facilitates long-term depression in stratum radiatum. As we have excluded the most likely intracellular signalling pathways that might mediate this long-range heterosynaptic effect, we consider the hypothesis that intercellular communication may be critically involved. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that extracellular ATP hydrolysis, and activation of adenosine A2 receptors are required to induce the metaplastic state. Moreover, delivery of the priming stimulation in stratum oriens elicited astrocytic calcium responses in stratum radiatum. Both the astrocytic responses and the metaplasticity were blocked by gap junction inhibitors. Taken together, these findings support a novel intercellular communication system, possibly involving astrocytes, being required for this type of heterosynaptic metaplasticity.},

We found that brief exposure to a novel environment lowered the threshold for the induction of LTP. This facilitatory effect was present for a short period following novelty exposure but was absent in animals that explored a familiar environment. Furthermore, the facilitation was dependent on activation of D1/D5 receptors.

Here we show that the identity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor glycine site agonist at synapses in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala may depend on the level of synaptic activation. Tonic activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors at synapses in the amygdala under low activity conditions is supported by ambient D-serine, whereas glycine may be released from astrocytes in response to afferent impulses. The release of glycine may decode the increases in afferent activity levels into enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated synaptic events, serving an essential function in the induction of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent long-term potentiation in fear conditioning pathways.},

Despite the availability of numerous monoaminergic-based antidepressants, most patients require several weeks, if not months, to respond to these treatments, and many patients never attain sustained remission of their symptoms. The non-competitive, glutamatergic NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) antagonist (R,S)-ketamine exerts rapid and sustained antidepressant effects after a single dose in patients with depression, but its use is associated with undesirable side effects. Here we show that the metabolism of (R,S)-ketamine to (2S,6S;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) is essential for its antidepressant effects, and that the (2R,6R)-HNK enantiomer exerts behavioural, electroencephalographic, electrophysiological and cellular antidepressant-related actions in mice. These antidepressant actions are independent of NMDAR inhibition but involve early and sustained activation of AMPARs (\ensuremath{\alpha}-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors). We also establish that (2R,6R)-HNK lacks ketamine-related side effects. Our data implicate a novel mechanism underlying the antidepressant properties of (R,S)-ketamine and have relevance for the development of next-generation, rapid-acting antidepressants.},

These processes are all localized to stimulated spines and account for the synapse-specificity of LTP. In the later stages of LTP, CaMKII has a structural role in enlarging and strengthening the synapse.},

  abstract = {Memories for certain events tend to linger in rich, vivid detail, and retrieval of these memories includes a sense of re-experiencing the details of the event. Most events, however, are not retained in any detailed way for more than a few days. According to one theory, the hippocampus plays a specific role in supporting episodic retrieval, that is, the re-experiencing of an event as part of one's personal past. This theory predicts that as episodic memories fade over time and are reduced to feelings of familiarity, activity in the hippocampus should no longer be associated with retrieval. We used high-resolution functional imaging to explore neural activity in medial temporal lobe subregions while participants performed a recognition task at both a short (10-min) and long (1-week) study-test delay. For each recognized item, subjects made "Remember/Know" judgments, allowing us to distinguish between items that were consistently episodic across the two tests and items that were initially episodic, but later became merely familiar. Our results demonstrate that activity in the subiculum is specifically associated with episodic recollection. Overall, recollected items were associated with higher activity in the subiculum than other items. For transiently recollected items, there was a decrease in subicular activity across the 1-week delay as memory faded from recollection to familiarity, whereas consistently recollected items were associated with enhanced subicular activity at both delays. These results provide evidence of a link between subicular activation and recollective experience.},

Here, we report the activity of single neurons in the human hippocampus and surrounding areas when subjects first view cinematic episodes consisting of audiovisual sequences and again later when they freely recall these episodes. A subset of these neurons exhibited selective firing, which often persisted throughout and following specific episodes for as long as 12 seconds. Verbal reports of memories of these specific episodes at the time of free recall were preceded by selective reactivation of the same hippocampal and entorhinal cortex neurons. We suggest that this reactivation is an internally generated neuronal correlate for the subjective experience of spontaneous emergence of human recollection.},

The recent availability of longitudinal data on the possible association of different lifestyles with dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) allow some preliminary conclusions on this topic. This review systematically analyses the published longitudinal studies exploring the effect of social network, physical leisure, and non-physical activity on cognition and dementia and then summarises the current evidence taking into account the limitations of the studies and the biological plausibility. For all three lifestyle components (social, mental, and physical), a beneficial effect on cognition and a protective effect against dementia are suggested. The three components seem to have common pathways, rather than specific mechanisms, which might converge within three major aetiological hypotheses for dementia and AD: the cognitive reserve hypothesis, the vascular hypothesis, and the stress hypothesis. Taking into account the accumulated evidence and the biological plausibility of these hypotheses, we conclude that an active and socially integrated lifestyle in late life protects against dementia and AD. Further research is necessary to better define the mechanisms of these associations and better delineate preventive and therapeutic strategies.},

Large spines contacted by thalamic afferents exhibited larger Ca2+ transients during action potential backpropagation than did small spines contacted by cortical afferents. Accordingly, induction of Hebbian plasticity, dependent on postsynaptic spikes, was restricted to thalamic afferents. This synapse-specific effect involved activation of R-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels preferentially located at thalamic inputs. These results indicate that afferent-specific mechanisms of postsynaptic, associative Hebbian plasticity in LA projection neurons depend on local, spine-specific morphological and molecular properties, rather than global differences between dendritic compartments.},

First, metaplasticity appears ideally placed to prepare for subsequent learning by either enhancing learning ability generally or by preparing neuronal networks to encode specific content. Second, metaplasticity can homeostatically regulate synaptic plasticity, and this likely has important behavioural consequences by stabilising synaptic weights while ensuring the ongoing availability of synaptic plasticity. Finally, we discuss emerging evidence that metaplasticity mechanisms may play a role in disease causally and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.},

Recent work has shown that stimulation of this pathway is antiapoptotic during development but proapoptotic in mature neurons exposed to excitotoxic or other stress. We now report that excitotoxic (N-methyl-D-aspartate) insults to mature cerebrocortical neurons activate caspase-3, -7, in turn cleaving MEF2A, C, and D isoforms. MEF2 cleavage fragments containing a truncated transactivation domain but preserved DNA-binding domain block MEF2 transcriptional activity via dominant interference. Transfection of constitutively active MEF2 (MEF2C-CA) rescues MEF2 transcriptional activity after N-methyl-D-aspartate insult and prevents neuronal apoptosis. Conversely, dominant-interfering MEF2 abrogates neuroprotection by MEF2C-CA. These results define a pathway to excitotoxic neuronal stress/apoptosis via caspase-catalyzed cleavage of MEF2. Additionally, we show that similar MEF2 cleavage fragments are generated in vivo during focal stroke damage. Hence, this pathway appears to have pathophysiological relevance in vivo.},

Neurons were identified as projection cells when they could be antidromically invaded from the perirhinal and/or entorhinal cortices. 2. In contrast with other nuclei of the amygdala, few spontaneously active neurons were encountered in the lateral nucleus. However, when hunting stimuli were applied to the parahippocampal cortices, we noticed the presence of numerous projection cells that would have otherwise remained undetected because they had little or no spontaneous activity. 3. In the states of waking, slow-wave sleep, and paradoxical sleep, the discharge rate of antidromically invaded neurons averaged 0.09 +/- 0.07 Hz (mean +/- SE) with 82\% of cells firing at \ensuremath{<} 0.01 Hz in all states. However, they transiently increased their firing rate when cats were presented complex sensory stimuli, which apparently were specific to each cell. In contrast to projection cells, spontaneously active neurons of the lateral nucleus that could not be backfired from the parahippocampal cortices had an average firing rate of 4.34 +/- 1.15 Hz with 38\% of cells firing at \ensuremath{>} or = 6 Hz in at least one state. 4. These results on the extremely low firing rates of identified projection cells suggest that previous extracellular studies of lateral amygdaloid neurons were biased toward a class of spontaneously active cells which probably includes local-circuit cells.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the relation between midlife alcohol consumption and mild cognitive impairment and dementia in old age, and the possible modification of this relation by apolipoprotein E.

DESIGN

Prospective, population based study.

SETTING

Populations of Kuopio and Joensuu, eastern Finland.

PARTICIPANTS

Of 1464 men and women aged 65-79 years randomly selected from population based samples studied in 1972 or 1977, 1018 (70\%) were re-examined in 1998 (after an average follow up of 23 years).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Mild cognitive impairment and dementia in old age.

RESULTS

Participants who drank no alcohol at midlife and those who drank alcohol frequently were both twice as likely to have mild cognitive impairment in old age as those participants who drank alcohol infrequently. The risk of dementia related to alcohol drinking was modified by the presence of the apolipoprotein e4 allele. The carriers of apolipoprotein e4 had an increased risk of dementia with increasing alcohol consumption: compared with non-carriers who never drank, the odds ratio for carriers who never drank was 0.6, for infrequent drinkers it was 2.3, and for frequent drinkers was 3.6 (the overall interaction term "drinking frequency(*)apolipoprotein e4" was significant (P = 0.04), as were the interactions "infrequent drinking(*)apolipoprotein e4" (P = 0.02) and "frequent drinking(*)apolipoprotein e4" (P = 0.03)). Non-carriers of apolipoprotein e4 had similar odds ratios for dementia irrespective of alcohol consumption.

CONCLUSION

Alcohol drinking in middle age showed a U shaped relation with risk of mild cognitive impairment in old age. Risk of dementia increased with increasing alcohol consumption only in those individuals carrying the apolipoprotein e4 allele.},

M. (1998) Neuroscience 87, 607-613]. To determine if a similar change is associated with spatial forms of learning, we have estimated time-dependent modulations of spine number in the dentate gyrus of the adult rat following water maze training. All animals exhibited significant reductions in the latency to locate the platform over the five training sessions of the single trial (median and interquartile ranges of 60, 8 versus 8, 3 s for trials 1 and 5, respectively) and this improved performance was retained just prior to killing at the 6h post-training time. The unbiased dissector stereological procedure was used to estimate spine number in serial pairs of ultrathin coronal sections obtained at a point 3.3 mm caudal of Bregma. This analysis revealed a significant learning-associated increase in spine number at the 6h post-training time (1.32+/-0.18 spines/microm(3)) as it was not observed in paired controls exposed to the water maze for a similar swim-time (0.66+/-0.11 spines/microm(3)). The increase was transient as spine number returned to control levels at the 72 h post-training time. These spine frequency changes are proposed to reflect increased synapse turnover rate and concomitant change in connectivity pattern in the processing of information for long-term storage.},

  abstract = {The amygdala has been repeatedly implicated in emotional processing of both positive and negative-valence stimuli. Previous studies suggest that the amygdala response to emotional stimuli is lower when the subject is in a meditative state of mindful-attention, both in beginner meditators after an 8-week meditation intervention and in expert meditators. However, the longitudinal effects of meditation training on amygdala responses have not been reported when participants are in an ordinary, non-meditative state. In this study, we investigated how 8 weeks of training in meditation affects amygdala responses to emotional stimuli in subjects when in a non-meditative state. Healthy adults with no prior meditation experience took part in 8 weeks of either Mindful Attention Training (MAT), Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT; a program based on Tibetan Buddhist compassion meditation practices), or an active control intervention. Before and after the intervention, participants underwent an fMRI experiment during which they were presented images with positive, negative, and neutral emotional valences from the IAPS database while remaining in an ordinary, non-meditative state. Using a region-of-interest analysis, we found a longitudinal decrease in right amygdala activation in the Mindful Attention group in response to positive images, and in response to images of all valences overall. In the CBCT group, we found a trend increase in right amygdala response to negative images, which was significantly correlated with a decrease in depression score. No effects or trends were observed in the control group. This finding suggests that the effects of meditation training on emotional processing might transfer to non-meditative states. This is consistent with the hypothesis that meditation training may induce learning that is not stimulus- or task-specific, but process-specific, and thereby may result in enduring changes in mental function.},

Small electric fields (\ensuremath{<}|40| mV mm-1), applied parallel to the somato-dendritic axis, induced polarization of CA1 pyramidal cells; the relationship between applied field and induced polarization was linear (0.12 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.05 mV per mV mm-1 average sensitivity at the soma). The peak amplitude and time constant (15\textendash{}70 ms) of membrane polarization varied along the axis of neurons with the maximal polarization observed at the tips of basal and apical dendrites. The polarization was biphasic in the mid-apical dendrites; there was a time-dependent shift in the polarity reversal site. DC fields altered the thresholds of action potentials evoked by orthodromic stimulation, and shifted their initiation site along the apical dendrites. Large electric fields could trigger neuronal firing and epileptiform activity, and induce long-term (\ensuremath{>}1 s) changes in neuronal excitability. Electric fields perpendicular to the apical\textendash{}dendritic axis did not induce somatic polarization, but did modulate orthodromic responses, indicating an effect on afferents. These results demonstrate that DC fields can modulate neuronal excitability in a time-dependent manner, with no clear threshold, as a result of interactions between neuronal compartments, the non-linear properties of the cell membrane, and effects on afferents.},

EEG spectrum analysis was carried out, wavelet entropies (WE) of EEG (together with reconstructed cortical sources) and heart rate were calculated, and their correlation was investigated. We found enhancement of EEG power of alpha and beta waves and lowering of delta waves power during MBSR training state as compared to normal resting state. Wavelet entropy analysis indicated that MBSR mindfulness meditation could reduce the chaotic activities of both EEG and heart rate as a change of state. However, longitudinal change of trait may need more long-term training. For the first time, our data demonstrated that the chaotic activities of the brain and the heart became more coordinated during MBSR training, suggesting that mindfulness training may increase the entrainment between mind and body.

  abstract = {``Use it or lose it'' is a popular adage often associated with use-dependent enhancement of cognitive abilities. Much research has focused on understanding exactly how the brain changes as a function of experience. Such experience-dependent plasticity involves both structural and functional alterations that contribute to adaptive behaviors, such as learning and memory, as well as maladaptive behaviors, including anxiety disorders, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder. With the advancing age of our population, understanding how use-dependent plasticity changes across the lifespan may also help to promote healthy brain aging. A common misconception is that such experience-dependent plasticity (e.g., associative learning) is synonymous with synaptic plasticity. Other forms of plasticity also play a critical role in shaping adaptive changes within the nervous system, including intrinsic plasticity \textendash{} a change in the intrinsic excitability of a neuron. Intrinsic plasticity can result from a change in the number, distribution or activity of various ion channels located throughout the neuron. Here, we review evidence that intrinsic plasticity is an important and evolutionarily conserved neural correlate of learning. Intrinsic plasticity acts as a metaplasticity mechanism by lowering the threshold for synaptic changes. Thus, learning-related intrinsic changes can facilitate future synaptic plasticity and learning. Such intrinsic changes can impact the allocation of a memory trace within a brain structure, and when compromised, can contribute to cognitive decline during the aging process. This unique role of intrinsic excitability can provide insight into how memories are formed and, more interestingly, how neurons that participate in a memory trace are selected. Most importantly, modulation of intrinsic excitability can allow for regulation of learning ability \textendash{} this can prevent or provide treatment for cognitive decline not only in patients with clinical disorders but also in the aging population.},

  abstract = {Retrospective studies suggest that precipitating events such as prolonged seizures, stroke, or head trauma increase the risk of developing epilepsy later in life. The process of epilepsy development, known as epileptogenesis, is associated with changes in the expression of a myriad of genes. One of the major challenges for the epilepsy research community has been to determine which of these changes contributes to epileptogenesis, which may be compensatory, and which may be noncontributory. Establishing this for any given gene is essential if it is to be considered a therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of epilepsy. Our laboratories have examined alterations in gene expression related to inhibitory neurotransmission that have been proposed as contributing factors in epileptogenesis. The GABA(A) receptor mediates most fast synaptic inhibition, and changes in GABA(A) receptor subunit expression and function have been reported in adult animals beginning immediately after prolonged seizures (status epilepticus [SE]) and continue as animals become chronically epileptic. Prevention of GABA(A) receptor subunit changes after SE using viral gene transfer inhibits development of epilepsy in an animal model, suggesting that these changes directly contribute to epileptogenesis. The mechanisms that regulate differential expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits in hippocampus after SE have recently been identified, and include the CREB-ICER, JAK-STAT, BDNF, and Egr3 signaling pathways. Targeting signaling pathways that alter the expression of genes involved in epileptogenesis may provide novel therapeutic approaches for preventing or inhibiting the development of epilepsy after a precipitating insult.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
Episodic memories are encoded within hippocampal and neocortical circuits. Retrieving these memories is assumed to involve reactivation of neural ensembles that were established during learning. Although it has been possible to follow the activity of individual neurons shortly after learning, it has not been possible to examine their activity weeks later during retrieval. We addressed this issue by using a stable form of GFP (H2B-GFP) to permanently tag neurons that are active during contextual fear conditioning.
Results
H2B-GFP expression in transgenic mice was increased by learning and could be regulated by doxycycline (DOX). Using this system, we found a large network of neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex that were active during context fear conditioning and subsequent memory retrieval 2~days later. Reactivation was contingent on memory retrieval and was not observed when animals were trained and tested in different environments. When memory was retrieved several weeks after learning, reactivation was altered in the hippocampus and amygdala but remained unchanged in the cortex.
Conclusions
Retrieving a recently formed context fear memory reactivates neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. Several weeks after learning, the degree of reactivation is altered in hippocampal and amygdala networks but remains stable in the cortex.},

Our aim was to determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, which enhances brain cortical excitability and activity, would modify performance in a sequential-letter working memory task when administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fifteen subjects underwent a three-back working memory task based on letters. This task was performed during sham and anodal stimulation applied over the left DLPFC. Moreover seven of these subjects performed the same task, but with inverse polarity (cathodal stimulation of the left DLPFC) and anodal stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1). Our results indicate that only anodal stimulation of the left prefrontal cortex, but not cathodal stimulation of left DLPFC or anodal stimulation of M1, increases the accuracy of the task performance when compared to sham stimulation of the same area. This accuracy enhancement during active stimulation cannot be accounted for by slowed responses, as response times were not changed by stimulation. Our results indicate that left prefrontal anodal stimulation leads to an enhancement of working memory performance. Furthermore, this effect depends on the stimulation polarity and is specific to the site of stimulation. This result may be helpful to develop future interventions aiming at clinical benefits.},

Our main hypothesis was that the concern for others cultivated during this form of meditation enhances affective processing, in particular in response to sounds of distress, and that this response to emotional sounds is modulated by the degree of meditation training. The presentation of the emotional sounds was associated with increased pupil diameter and activation of limbic regions (insula and cingulate cortices) during meditation (versus rest). During meditation, activation in insula was greater during presentation of negative sounds than positive or neutral sounds in expert than it was in novice meditators. The strength of activation in insula was also associated with self-reported intensity of the meditation for both groups. These results support the role of the limbic circuitry in emotion sharing. The comparison between meditation vs. rest states between experts and novices also showed increased activation in amygdala, right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in response to all sounds, suggesting, greater detection of the emotional sounds, and enhanced mentation in response to emotional human vocalizations for experts than novices during meditation. Together these data indicate that the mental expertise to cultivate positive emotion alters the activation of circuitries previously linked to empathy and theory of mind in response to emotional stimuli.},

We developed a high-throughput method to quantify yeast sporulation efficiency and used this technique to analyze a line cross between a high-efficiency oak tree isolate and a low-efficiency wine strain. We find that natural variation in sporulation efficiency mirrors natural variation in higher eukaryotes: it shows divergence between isolated populations, arises from loci of major effect, and exhibits epistasis. We show that the lower sporulation efficiency of the wine strain results from a failure to initiate sporulation, rather than from slower kinetics of meiosis and spore formation. The two strains differentially regulate many genes involved in aerobic respiration, an essential pathway for sporulation, such that the oak tree strain appears better poised to generate energy from this pathway. We also report that a polymorphism in RME1 that affects sporulation efficiency in laboratory strains also cosegregates with significant phenotypic differences in our cross of natural isolates. These results lay the groundwork for the study of variation in sporulation efficiency among natural isolates of yeast.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims
Alterations in the microbial composition of the gastrointestinal tract (dysbiosis) are believed to contribute to inflammatory and functional bowel disorders and psychiatric comorbidities. We examined whether the intestinal microbiota affects behavior and brain biochemistry in mice.
Methods
Specific pathogen\textendash{}free (SPF) BALB/c mice, with or without subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or chemical sympathectomy, or germ-free BALB/c mice received a mixture of nonabsorbable antimicrobials (neomycin, bacitracin, and pimaricin) in their drinking water for 7 days. Germ-free BALB/c and NIH Swiss mice were colonized with microbiota from SPF NIH Swiss or BALB/c mice. Behavior was evaluated using step-down and light preference tests. Gastrointestinal microbiota were assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Gut samples were analyzed by histologic, myeloperoxidase, and cytokine analyses; levels of serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Administration of oral antimicrobials to SPF mice transiently altered the composition of the microbiota and increased exploratory behavior and hippocampal expression of BDNF. These changes were independent of inflammatory activity, changes in levels of gastrointestinal neurotransmitters, and vagal or sympathetic integrity. Intraperitoneal administration of antimicrobials to SPF mice or oral administration to germ-free mice did not affect behavior. Colonization of germ-free BALB/c mice with microbiota from NIH Swiss mice increased exploratory behavior and hippocampal levels of BDNF, whereas colonization of germ-free NIH Swiss mice with BALB/c microbiota reduced exploratory behavior.
Conclusions
The intestinal microbiota influences brain chemistry and behavior independently of the autonomic nervous system, gastrointestinal-specific neurotransmitters, or inflammation. Intestinal dysbiosis might contribute to psychiatric disorders in patients with bowel disorders.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soluble oligomers of amyloid \ss{}-protein (A\ss{}) have been increasingly linked to synaptic dysfunction, tau alteration, and neuritic dystrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mouse models. There is a great need for assays that quantify A\ss{} oligomers with high specificity and sensitivity.
METHODS: We designed and validated two oligomer-specific (o-) enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) using either an A\ss{} aggregate-selective monoclonal for capture and a monoclonal to the free N-terminus for detection, or the latter antibody for both capture and detection.
RESULTS: The o-ELISAs specifically quantified pure oligomers of synthetic A\ss{} with sizes from dimers up to much larger assemblies and over a wide dynamic range of concentrations, whereas A\ss{} monomers were undetectable. Natural A\ss{} oligomers of similarly wide size and concentration ranges were measured in extracts of AD and control brains, revealing \ensuremath{>}1000-fold higher concentrations of A\ss{} oligomers than monomers in the soluble fraction of AD cortex. The assays quantified the age-related rise in oligomers in hAPP transgenic mice. Unexpectedly, none of 90 human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples gave a specific signal in either o-ELISA.
CONCLUSIONS: These new o-ELISAs with rigorously confirmed specificity can quantify oligomer burden in human and mouse brains for diagnostic and mechanistic studies and for AD biomarker development. However, our data raise the likelihood that the hydrophobicity of A\ss{} oligomers makes them very low in number or absent in aqueous CSF.},

  abstract = {Visual pathways to the amygdala, a brain structure critical for classical fear conditioning, were investigated. Conditioned fear was measured in rats as increased acoustic startle amplitude in the presence versus absence of a light or an odor paired previously with foot shock (fear-potentiated startle). Post-training lesions of both the lateral geniculate body (LG) and lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of the thalamus together, but not lesions of LG or LP alone, completely blocked the expression of fear-potentiated startle to a visual conditioned stimulus (CS) but not to an olfactory CS. These lesions also did not block contextual fear conditioning using startle or freezing as measures. Local infusion of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f] quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium, an AMPA antagonist, into the visual thalamus immediately before testing also blocked fear-potentiated startle to a visual CS, suggesting that the lesion effects were not attributable to damage of fibers of passage. Iontophoretic injections into the LP of the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine resulted in heavy anterograde labeling in two amygdala-fugal cortical areas: area TE2 and dorsal perirhinal cortex (PR), and moderate labeling in the lateral amygdaloid nucleus (L). These results suggest that, during classical fear conditioning, a visual stimulus can be transmitted to the amygdala via either lemniscal (i.e., LG --\ensuremath{>} V1, V2 --\ensuremath{>} TE2/PR) or non-lemniscal (i.e., LP --\ensuremath{>} V2, TE2/PR) thalamo-cortico-amygdala pathways, or direct thalamo-amygdala (i.e., LP --\ensuremath{>} L) projections.},

This method utilizes mice in which the tamoxifen-dependent recombinase CreER(T2) is expressed in an activity-dependent manner from the loci of the immediate early genes Arc and Fos. Active cells that express CreER(T2) can only undergo recombination when tamoxifen is present, allowing genetic access to neurons that are active during a time window of less than 12~hr. We show that TRAP can provide selective access to neurons activated by specific somatosensory, visual, and auditory stimuli and by experience in a novel environment. When combined with tools for labeling, tracing, recording, and manipulating neurons, TRAP offers a powerful approach for understanding how the brain processes information and generates behavior.},

  abstract = {Neurons intensively exchange information among each other using both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. However, if the balance of excitation and inhibition is perturbed, the intensity of excitatory transmission may exceed a certain threshold and epileptic seizures can occur. As the occurrence of epilepsy in the human population is about 1\%, the search for therapeutic targets to alleviate seizures is warranted. Extracts of Cannabis sativa have a long history in the treatment of various neurological diseases, including epilepsy. However, cannabinoids have been reported to exert both pro- and anti-convulsive activities. The recent progress in understanding the endogenous cannabinoid system has allowed new insights into these opposing effects of cannabinoids. When excessive neuronal activity occurs, endocannabinoids are generated on demand and activate cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. Using mice lacking CB1 receptors in principal forebrain neurons in a model of epileptiform seizures, it was shown that CB1 receptors expressed on excitatory glutamatergic neurons mediate the anti-convulsive activity of endocannabinoids. Systemic activation of CB1 receptors by exogenous cannabinoids, however, are anti- or pro-convulsive, depending on the seizure model used. The pro-convulsive activity of exogenous cannabinoids might be explained by the notion that CB1 receptors expressed on inhibitory GABAergic neurons are also activated, leading to a decreased release of GABA, and to a concomitant increase in seizure susceptibility. The concept that the endogenous cannabinoid system is activated on demand suggests that a promising strategy to alleviate seizure frequency is the enhancement of endocannabinoid levels by inhibiting the cellular uptake and the degradation of these endogenous compounds.},

  abstract = {How the brain determines which memories are selected for long-term storage is critical for a full understanding of memory. One possibility is that memories are selected based on the history of activity and current state of neurons within a given memory circuit. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated metaplasticity-like effects whereby prior neuronal activity can affect the ability of cells to express synaptic plasticity in the future; however, the significance of these findings to memory is less clear. Here we show in rats that a single pairing of a light with shock, insufficient to support either short- or long-term fear memory, primes future learning such that another trial delivered within a circumscribed time window lasting from \ensuremath{\sim}60 min to 3 d results in the formation of a long-lasting and robust fear memory. Two adequately spaced training trials support long-term fear memory only if the two trials are signaled by the same cue. Furthermore, although a single training trial does not support formation of an observable fear memory, it does result in the phosphorylation of several targets of protein kinase A (PKA) in the amygdala. Accordingly, blocking PKA signaling in the amygdala before the first training trial completely prevents the ability of that trial to facilitate the formation of long-term fear memory when a second trial is delivered 24 h later. These findings may provide insight into how memories are selected for long-term storage.},

The immediate-shock freezing deficit paradigm was used to compare rats that received footshock after exploring a context to rats that received footshock immediately after placement in the chamber. The former procedure produces contextual fear conditioning while the latter does not. Rats were either handled (handled group), placed in a test chamber without receiving footshock (context-no-footshock group), received footshock immediately upon being placed in the chamber (immediate-footshock group), or received footshock after a 1 min delay (delayed-footshock group). Only the delayed-footshock group displayed a fear response (freezing behavior). Rats were sacrificed either 15 min after the experience or after a retention test 24 h later. The c-fos mRNA was increased in the medial nucleus of the amygdala in all of the groups that were placed in the test chamber. However, rats that received footshock (immediate- and delayed-footshock groups) had greater levels of c-fos mRNA expression than rats of the context-no-footshock group. The c-fos mRNA expression in the immediate- and delayed-footshock groups did not differ. However, after the retention test, the expression of c-fos mRNA in the medial nucleus of the amygdala did not differ between groups. In contrast to c-fos, NGFI-A mRNA expression in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala was greater in the delayed-footshock group than the handled and context-no-footshock groups 15 min after the footshock. This elevation in NGFI-A mRNA was not seen in the immediate-footshock group. This suggests that NGFI-A mRNA in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala may play a role in contextual fear conditioning.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which long-term memories are formed and stored in the brain represents a central aim of neuroscience. Prevailing theory suggests that long-term memory encoding involves early plasticity within hippocampal circuits, whereas reorganization of the neocortex is thought to occur weeks to months later to subserve remote memory storage. Here we report that long-term memory encoding can elicit early transcriptional, structural, and functional remodeling of the neocortex. Parallel studies using genome-wide RNA sequencing, ultrastructural imaging, and whole-cell recording in wild-type mice suggest that contextual fear conditioning initiates a transcriptional program in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that is accompanied by rapid expansion of the synaptic active zone and postsynaptic density, enhanced dendritic spine plasticity, and increased synaptic efficacy. To address the real-time contribution of the mPFC to long-term memory encoding, we performed temporally precise optogenetic inhibition of excitatory mPFC neurons during contextual fear conditioning. Using this approach, we found that real-time inhibition of the mPFC inhibited activation of the entorhinal\textendash{}hippocampal circuit and impaired the formation of long-term associative memory. These findings suggest that encoding of long-term episodic memory is associated with early remodeling of neocortical circuits, identify the prefrontal cortex as a critical regulator of encoding-induced hippocampal activation and long-term memory formation, and have important implications for understanding memory processing in healthy and diseased brain states.},

Two classes were distinguished based upon electrotonic properties and the presence (IB) or absence (IA) of vasointestinal peptide (VIP). Four classes of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67) containing interneurons were encountered. Class III reflected ``classical'' interneurons, generating fast spikes with no frequency adaptation. Class II neurons generated fast spikes with early frequency adaptation and differed from class III by the presence of VIP and the relatively rare presence of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin (SOM). Class IV and V were not clearly separated by molecular markers, but by membrane potential values and spike patterns. Morphologically, projection neurons were large, spiny cells, whereas the other neuronal classes displayed smaller somata and spine-sparse dendrites.},

Contextual fear memories in rodents rely on the hippocampus immediately following training but are unaffected by hippocampal lesions or pharmacological inhibition weeks later. With fast optogenetic methods, we examine the real-time contribution of hippocampal CA1 excitatory neurons to remote memory and find that contextual fear memory recall, even weeks after training, can be reversibly abolished by temporally precise optogenetic inhibition of CA1. When this inhibition is extended to match the typical time course of pharmacological inhibition, remote hippocampus dependence converts to hippocampus independence, suggesting that long-term memory retrieval normally depends on the hippocampus but can adaptively shift to alternate structures. Further revealing the plasticity of mechanisms required for memory recall, we confirm the remote-timescale importance of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and implicate CA1 in ACC recruitment for remote recall.},

  abstract = {In an attempt to study the effects of piriform cortex damage on kindled seizure propagation, we administered kainic acid (12 mg/kg; i.p.) to rats previously kindled from the dorsal hippocampus. Unexpectedly, the ensuing status epilepticus (SE) in the kindled rats did not result in the piriform cortex damage normally observed in naive rats. As a result of this surprising finding, a more comprehensive investigation was undertaken to compare dorsal hippocampal kindled and control rats on their electrographic and behavioral SE development and subsequent brain damage. The SE induction profile and the pattern of brain damage observed in our control rats was similar to previous reports [Neuroscience, 14 (1985) 375-403; Brain Res., 218 (1981) 299-318]. By contrast, although fewer kindled rats than controls responded to the initial dose of kainic acid with electrographic and behavioral seizures, those many kindled rats that did respond, showed a pattern of SE induction that was different from controls. Kindled rats manifested fewer 'wet dog shakes', more generalized convulsions and a faster development of severe limbic status (SLS) than controls. In addition, without pharmacological intervention, the SLS continued longer in kindled rats than in controls. Histological examination revealed brain damage in kindled rats that was markedly different from controls. Unlike controls, kindled rats had no damage in the piriform cortex or substantia nigra reticulata and minimal hippocampal damage, yet showed midline thalamic and anterior olfactory nuclei damage similar to controls. These differences were observed from 1 to 28 days after kindling. Although the mechanism(s) of this kindling-based neuroprotection is not known, its discovery should add importantly to our understanding of epilepsy-induced alterations of subsequent neuronal function.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00213-002-1150-y},
  abstract = {RATIONALE: Activation of the neuronal sigma(1) (sigma(1)) receptor potentiates calcium mobilization, leading to effective modulation of postsynaptic responses to neurotransmitters. At the behavioral level, sigma(1) agonists modulate learning, response to stress and depression. In particular, the selective sigma(1) agonist igmesine reduced immobility in the forced swimming test.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of modulators of Ca(2+) influx and mobilization, administered intracerebroventricularly at doses ineffective alone, on the igmesine effect. The tricyclic antidepressant desipramine was also studied for comparison.
RESULTS: The calcium chelator EGTA blocked both igmesine and desipramine-induced decreases of immobility duration, indicating the importance of extracellular Ca(2+) influx in the initial action of each compound. Both L- and N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) appeared involved in the sigma(1) agonist effect. Verapamil, an L-type VDCC antagonist or omega-conotoxin GVI, a N-type VDCC antagonist, blocked whereas (-)-Bay K8644, a L-type VDCC agonist, potentiated the igmesine effect. Mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores is involved selectively in the effect mediated by the sigma(1) receptor, since the membrane permeable intracellular Ca(2+) chelator EGTA/AM affected only the igmesine effect. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptor-sensitive Ca(2+) pools appeared primarily involved, rather than Ca(2+)/caffeine-sensitive Ca(2+) pools. Indeed, the InsP(3) receptor positive modulator bradykinin potentiated, whereas the InsP(3) receptor antagonist xestospongin C blocked the igmesine effect. The ryanodine receptor agonist caffeine failed to affect the efficacy of igmesine, whereas the antagonist ryanodine reduced it.
CONCLUSIONS: The sigma(1) receptor-mediated behavioral effect is dependent not only on rapid Ca(2+) influx, as observed for a classical antidepressant, but also on intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization.},

These studies support the notion that metaplasticity is also operative in the human brain and is mostly homeostatic in nature, that is, keeping network activity within a physiological range. However, non-homeostatic metaplasticity has also been described, which can increase non-invasive brain stimulation\textendash{}induced aftereffects on cortical excitability, or learning. Current evidence further suggests that aberrant metaplasticity may underlie some neurological and psychiatric diseases. Finally, first proof-of-principle studies show that the concept of metaplasticity can be harnessed for treatment of patients suffering from brain diseases.},

  abstract = {In cortical networks, different types of inhibitory interneurons control the activity of glutamatergic principal cells and GABAergic interneurons. Principal neurons represent the major postsynaptic target of most interneurons; however, a population of interneurons that is dedicated to the selective innervation of GABAergic cells exists in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. The physiological properties of these cells and their functional relevance for network computations remain unknown. Here, we used a combination of dual simultaneous patch-clamp recordings and targeted optogenetic stimulation in acute mouse hippocampal slices to examine how one class of interneuron-specific (IS) cells controls the activity of its GABAergic targets. We found that type 3 IS (IS3) cells that coexpress the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and calretinin contact several distinct types of interneurons within the hippocampal CA1 stratum oriens/alveus (O/A), with preferential innervation of oriens-lacunosum moleculare cells (OLMs) through dendritic synapses. In contrast, VIP-positive basket cells provided perisomatic inhibition to CA1 pyramidal neurons with the asynchronous GABA release and were not connected with O/A interneurons. Furthermore, unitary IPSCs recorded at IS3\textendash{}OLM synapses had a small amplitude and low release probability but summated efficiently during high-frequency firing of IS3 interneurons. Moreover, the synchronous generation of a single spike in several IS cells that converged onto a single OLM controlled the firing rate and timing of OLM interneurons. Therefore, dendritic inhibition originating from IS cells is needed for the flexible activity-dependent recruitment of OLM interneurons for feedback inhibition.},

Twenty-two male Chinese expert meditators (11 FAM experts, 11 LKM experts) and 22 male Chinese novice meditators (11 FAM novices, 11 LKM novices) had their brain activity monitored by a 3T MRI scanner while performing the cognitive and affective tasks in both meditation and baseline states. We examined the interaction between state (meditation vs. baseline) and expertise (expert vs. novice) separately during LKM and FAM, using a conjunction approach to reveal common regions sensitive to the expert meditative state. Additionally, exclusive masking techniques revealed distinct interactions between state and group during LKM and FAM. Specifically, we demonstrated that the practice of FAM was associated with expertise-related behavioral improvements and neural activation differences in attention task performance. However, the effect of state LKM meditation did not carry over to attention task performance. On the other hand, both FAM and LKM practice appeared to affect the neural responses to affective pictures. For viewing sad faces, the regions activated for FAM practitioners were consistent with attention-related processing; whereas responses of LKM experts to sad pictures were more in line with differentiating emotional contagion from compassion/emotional regulation processes. Our findings provide the first report of distinct neural activity associated with forms of meditation during sustained attention and emotion processing.},

  abstract = {Background: Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) for neuropathic pain control induces focal cerebral blood flow changes involving regions with high density of opioid receptors. We studied the possible contribution of the endogenous opioid system to MCS-related pain relief.
Methods: Changes in opioid receptor availability induced by MCS were studied with PET scan and [11C]diprenorphine in eight patients with refractory neuropathic pain. Each patient underwent two preoperative (test\textendash{}retest) PET scans and one postoperative PET scan acquired after 7 months of chronic MCS.
Results: The two preoperative scans, performed at 2 weeks interval, did not show significant differences. Conversely, postoperative compared with preoperative PET scans revealed significant decreases of [11C]diprenorphine binding in the anterior middle cingulate cortex (aMCC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum. Binding changes in aMCC and PAG were significantly correlated with pain relief.
Conclusion: The decrease in binding of the exogenous ligand was most likely explained by receptor occupancy due to enhanced secretion of endogenous opioids. Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) may thus induce release of endogenous opioids in brain structures involved in the processing of acute and chronic pain. Correlation of this effect with pain relief in at least two of these structures supports the role of the endogenous opioid system in pain control induced by MCS.},

In addition to attentional network analyses, overall attentional processing was analysed by means of efficiency scores (i.e., accuracy controlled for reaction time). Better orienting and executive attention (reflected by smaller differences in either reaction time or error score, respectively) were observed in the mindfulness meditation group. Furthermore, extensive mindfulness meditation appeared to be related to a reduction of the fraction of errors for responses with the same reaction time. These results provide new insights into differences in attentional processing related to mindfulness meditation and suggest the possibility of increasing the efficiency in attentional processing by extensive mental training.},

                  Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administration has been shown to reduce 
accumulation of abdominal visceral fat and protect against insulin resistance

obesity in humans. DHEA is widely available as a dietary supplement without 
a prescription.Objective~ 
                  To determine whether DHEA replacement therapy decreases abdominal fat 
and improves insulin action in elderly persons.Design and Setting~ 
                  Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in a US 
university-based research center from June 2001 to February 2004.Participants~ 
                  Fifty-six elderly persons (28 women and 28 men aged 71 [range, 65-78] 
years) with age-related decrease in DHEA level.Intervention~ 
                  Participants were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg/d of DHEA or matching 
placebo for 6 months.Main Outcome Measures~ 
                  The primary outcome measures were 6-month change in visceral and subcutaneous 
abdominal fat measured by magnetic resonance imaging and glucose and insulin 
responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).Results~ 
                  Of the 56 men and women enrolled, 52 underwent follow-up evaluations. 
Compliance with the intervention was 97\% in the DHEA group and 95\% in the 
placebo group. Based on intention-to-treat analyses, DHEA therapy compared 
with placebo induced significant decreases in visceral fat area (\textendash{}13 
cm2 vs +3 cm2, respectively; P~=~.001) 
and subcutaneous fat (\textendash{}13 cm2 vs +2 cm2, P~=~.003). The insulin area under the curve (AUC)

  abstract = {Plasticity of the nervous system is dependent on mechanisms that regulate the strength of synaptic transmission. Excitatory synapses in the brain undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), cellular models of learning and memory. Protein phosphorylation is required for the induction of many forms of synaptic plasticity, including LTP and LTD. However, the critical kinase substrates that mediate plasticity have not been identified. We previously reported that phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors, which mediate rapid excitatory transmission in the brain, is modulated during LTP and LTD. To test if GluR1 phosphorylation is necessary for plasticity and learning and memory, we generated mice with knockin mutations in the GluR1 phosphorylation sites. The phosphomutant mice show deficits in LTD and LTP and have memory defects in spatial learning tasks. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of GluR1 is critical for LTD and LTP expression and the retention of memories.},

Neuronal recordings and activation patterns revealed with neuroimaging methods have shown considerable plasticity of MI representations and cell properties following pathological or traumatic changes and in relation to everyday experience, including motor-skill learning and cognitive motor actions. The intrinsic horizontal neuronal connections in MI are a strong candidate substrate for map reorganization: They interconnect large regions of MI, they show activity-dependent plasticity, and they modify in association with skill learning. These findings suggest that MI cortex is not simply a static motor control structure. It also contains a dynamic substrate that participates in motor learning and possibly in cognitive events as well.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) into senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a hallmark neuropathological feature of the disorder, which likely contributes to alterations in neuronal structure and function. Recent work has revealed changes in neurite architecture associated with plaques and functional changes in cortical signaling in amyloid precursor protein (APP) expressing mouse models of AD. Here we developed a method using gene transfer techniques to introduce green fluorescent protein (GFP) into neurons, allowing the investigation of neuronal processes in the vicinity of plaques. Multiphoton imaging of GFP-labeled neurons in living Tg2576 APP mice revealed disrupted neurite trajectories and reductions in dendritic spine density compared with age-matched control mice. A profound deficit in spine density (approximately 50\%) extends approximately 20 mum from plaque edges. Importantly, a robust decrement (approximately 25\%) also occurs on dendrites not associated with plaques, suggesting widespread loss of postsynaptic apparatus. Plaques and dendrites remained stable over the course of weeks of imaging. Postmortem analysis of axonal immunostaining and colocalization of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density 95 protein staining around plaques indicate a parallel loss of presynaptic and postsynaptic partners. These results show considerable changes in dendrites and dendritic spines in APP transgenic mice, demonstrating a dramatic synaptotoxic effect of dense-cored plaques. Decreased spine density will likely contribute to altered neural system function and behavioral impairments observed in Tg2576 mice.},

  abstract = {Many lines of evidence suggest that memory in the mammalian brain is stored with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Despite recent progresses in identifying neuronal populations involved in memory coding, the synapse-level mechanism is still poorly understood. Computational models and electrophysiological data have shown that functional clustering of synapses along dendritic branches leads to nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs and greatly expands the computing power of a neural network. However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy, we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines. Our findings suggest that clustering of new synapses along dendrites is induced by repetitive activation of the cortical circuitry during learning, providing a structural basis for spatial coding of motor memory in the mammalian brain.},

We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes. Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names.

Neural activity could then be specifically and inducibly increased in the hM(3)D(q)-expressing neurons by an exogenous ligand. When an ensemble of neurons for one context (ctxA) was artificially activated during conditioning in a distinct second context (ctxB), mice formed a hybrid memory representation. Reactivation of the artificially stimulated network within the conditioning context was required for retrieval of the memory, and the memory was specific for the spatial pattern of neurons artificially activated during learning. Similar stimulation impaired recall when not part of the initial conditioning.},

Fourteen children (8\textendash{}15~years) with ADHD defined according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria were randomly allocated to 30 sessions of EEG-neurofeedback (n~=~8) or placebo feedback (n~=~6). Safety measures (adverse events and sleep problems), ADHD symptoms and global improvement were monitored. With respect to feasibility, all children completed the study and attended all study visits and training sessions. No significant adverse effects or sleep problems were reported. Regarding the expectancy, 75\% of children and their parent(s) in the active neurofeedback group and 50\% of children and their parent(s) in the placebo feedback group thought they received placebo feedback training. Analyses revealed significant improvements of ADHD symptoms over time, but changes were similar for both groups. This pilot study shows that it is feasible to conduct a rigorous placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of neurofeedback training in children with ADHD. However, a double-blind design may not be feasible since using automatic adjusted reward thresholds may not work as effective as manually adjusted reward thresholds. Additionally, implementation of active learning strategies may be an important factor for the efficacy of EEG-neurofeedback training. Based on the results of this pilot study, changes are made in the design of the ongoing study.},

The purpose of this review is to elucidate which components of executive functioning benefit from such exercise in healthy populations. In light of the developmental time course of executive functions, we consider separately children, young adults, and older adults. Data to date from studies of aging provide strong evidence of exercise-linked benefits related to task switching, selective attention, inhibition of prepotent responses, and working memory capacity; furthermore, cross-sectional fitness data suggest that working memory updating could potentially benefit as well. In young adults, working memory updating is the main executive function shown to benefit from regular exercise, but cross-sectional data further suggest that task-switching and posterror performance may also benefit. In children, working memory capacity has been shown to benefit, and cross-sectional data suggest potential benefits for selective attention and inhibitory control. Although more research investigating exercise-related benefits for specific components of executive functioning is clearly needed in young adults and children, when considered across the age groups, ample evidence indicates that regular engagement in aerobic exercise can provide a simple means for healthy people to optimize a range of executive functions.},

During meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae four daughter cells, called spores, are generated within the boundaries of the mother cell. This cell differentiation process requires de novo synthesis of prospore membranes (PSMs), which are the precursors of the spore plasma membranes. Assembly of these membranes is initiated at the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) during meiosis II. At this stage of the cell cycle, 4 SPBs are present. Two different meiosis-specific structures are known to be required for PSM formation. At the SPBs, specialized attachments, called the meiotic plaques, provide the required functionality necessary for the recruitment and assembly of the membranes. During subsequent membrane elongation, a second structure becomes important. This proteinaceous assembly forms a coat, called the leading edge protein coat (LEP coat), which covers the boundaries of the membranes. Assembly of the coat occurs at sites next to the SPBs, whereas its disassembly is concomitant to the closure of the membranes. This mini review discusses our current understanding of how the meiotic plaque and the LEP coat might function during biogenesis of the prospore membrane.},

However, virtually nothing is known about the impact of the voluntary generation of compassion on this network. To investigate these questions we assessed brain activity using fMRI while novice and expert meditation practitioners generated a loving-kindness-compassion meditation state. To probe affective reactivity, we presented emotional and neutral sounds during the meditation and comparison periods. Our main hypothesis was that the concern for others cultivated during this form of meditation enhances affective processing, in particular in response to sounds of distress, and that this response to emotional sounds is modulated by the degree of meditation training. The presentation of the emotional sounds was associated with increased pupil diameter and activation of limbic regions (insula and cingulate cortices) during meditation (versus rest). During meditation, activation in insula was greater during presentation of negative sounds than positive or neutral sounds in expert than it was in novice meditators. The strength of activation in insula was also associated with self-reported intensity of the meditation for both groups. These results support the role of the limbic circuitry in emotion sharing. The comparison between meditation vs. rest states between experts and novices also showed increased activation in amygdala, right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in response to all sounds, suggesting, greater detection of the emotional sounds, and enhanced mentation in response to emotional human vocalizations for experts than novices during meditation. Together these data indicate that the mental expertise to cultivate positive emotion alters the activation of circuitries previously linked to empathy and theory of mind in response to emotional stimuli.},

  abstract = {In an attempt to study the effects of piriform cortex damage on kindled seizure propagation, we administered kainic acid (12 mg/kg; i.p.) to rats previously kindled from the dorsal hippocampus. Unexpectedly, the ensuing status epilepticus (SE) in the kindled rats did not result in the piriform cortex damage normally observed in naive rats. As a result of this surprising finding, a more comprehensive investigation was undertaken to compare dorsal hippocampal kindled and control rats on their electrographic and behavioral SE development and subsequent brain damage. The SE induction profile and the pattern of brain damage observed in our control rats was similar to previous reports [Neuroscience, 14 (1985) 375-403; Brain Res., 218 (1981) 299-318]. By contrast, although fewer kindled rats than controls responded to the initial dose of kainic acid with electrographic and behavioral seizures, those many kindled rats that did respond, showed a pattern of SE induction that was different from controls. Kindled rats manifested fewer 'wet dog shakes', more generalized convulsions and a faster development of severe limbic status (SLS) than controls. In addition, without pharmacological intervention, the SLS continued longer in kindled rats than in controls. Histological examination revealed brain damage in kindled rats that was markedly different from controls. Unlike controls, kindled rats had no damage in the piriform cortex or substantia nigra reticulata and minimal hippocampal damage, yet showed midline thalamic and anterior olfactory nuclei damage similar to controls. These differences were observed from 1 to 28 days after kindling.

Cortical function is regulated by a strikingly diverse array of local-circuit inhibitory neurons. We evaluated how optogenetically activating somatostatin- and parvalbumin-positive interneurons subtractively or divisively suppressed auditory cortical cells' responses to tones. In both awake and anesthetized animals, we found that activating either family of~interneurons produced mixtures of divisive and subtractive effects and that simultaneously recorded neurons were often suppressed in qualitatively different ways. A simple network model shows that threshold nonlinearities can interact with network activity to transform subtractive inhibition of neurons into divisive inhibition of networks, or vice versa. Varying threshold and the strength of suppression of a model neuron could determine whether the effect of inhibition appeared divisive, subtractive, or~both. We conclude that the characteristics of response inhibition specific to a single interneuron type can be ``masked'' by the network configuration and cellular properties of the network in which they are embedded.},

Here, we analyzed changes in their expression and function following a mechanical lesion in the CA1 area of organotypic hippocampal slices. 6-7 days after lesion, a glial scar had formed along the injury site, containing strongly activated astrocytes with increased GFAP and S100\ensuremath{\beta} immunoreactivity, enlarged somata, and reduced capability for uptake of SR101. Astrocytes in the scar's periphery were swollen as well, but showed only moderate upregulation of GFAP and S100\ensuremath{\beta} and efficiently took up SR101. In the scar, clusters of GLT-1 and GLAST immunoreactivity colocalized with GFAP-positive fibers. Apart from these, GLT-1 immunoreactivity declined with increasing distance from the scar, whereas GLAST expression appeared largely uniform. Sodium imaging in reactive astrocytes indicated that glutamate uptake was strongly reduced in the scar but maintained in the periphery. Our results thus show that moderately reactive astrocytes in the lesion periphery maintain overall glutamate transporter expression and function. Strongly reactive astrocytes in the scar, however, display clusters of GLAST and GLT-1 immunoreactivity together with reduced glutamate transport activity. This reduction might contribute to increased extracellular glutamate concentrations and promote excitotoxic cell damage at the lesion site.},

This synaptotropic hypothesis of dendritic branching predicts that dendritic growth will be directed preferentially into regions containing numerous prospective presynaptic elements. The developing mouse spinal cord provides a natural experiment to test this prediction, because synapses are found exclusively within the marginal zones bordering the motor columns during the early (E11-14) period of synaptogenesis. During this time, therefore, most motor dendritic growth would be expected to be directed laterally or ventrally into the marginal zones, whereas internally directed growth should become more prevalent later, when synaptogenesis begins to take place within the intermediate zone, i.e., the motor columns proper. A computer-assisted three dimensional reconstruction system has been used to test these expectations in Golgi preparations of developing mouse (C57BL/6J) spinal cords ranging in age from E13 through P1. Mean dendritic lengths and branch densities are significantly greater for marginal zone dendrites than for intermediate zone dendrites at early ages (E13-14), but there are no significant differences in these measures at later stages of development (P0,1). These findings are interpreted as meaning that motor dendritic growth is initially biased into the marginal zone by synaptogenic afferents and that this preferential distribution is progressively lost as synapses develop within the intermediate zone to attract or to stabilize internally directed dendritic growth. Thus the findings of this study are consistent with predictions of the synaptotropic hypothesis of dendritic branching.},

Memories are acquired and encoded within large-scale neuronal networks spanning different brain areas. The anatomical and functional specificity of such long-range interactions and their role in learning is poorly understood. The amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are interconnected brain structures involved in the extinction of conditioned fear. Here, we show that a defined subpopulation of basal amygdala (BA) projection neurons targeting the prelimbic (PL) subdivision of mPFC is active during states of high fear, whereas BA neurons targeting the infralimbic (IL) subdivision are recruited, and exhibit cell-type-specific plasticity, during fear extinction. Pathway-specific optogenetic manipulations demonstrate that the activity balance between pathways is causally involved in fear extinction. Together, our findings demonstrate that, although intermingled locally, long-range connectivity defines distinct subpopulations of amygdala projection neurons and indicate that the formation of long-term extinction memories depends on the balance of activity between two defined amygdala-prefrontal pathways.},

Notably, infralimbic prefrontal (IL) input to mITC neurons is thought to play a key role in fear extinction. Here, using targeted optogenetic stimulation, we show that lITC neurons receive auditory input from cortical and thalamic regions. IL inputs innervate principal neurons in the BLA but not mITC neurons. These results suggest that (1) these neurons may play a more central role in fear learning as both lITCs and mITCs receive auditory input and that (2) mITC neurons cannot be driven directly by the IL, and their role in fear extinction is likely mediated via the BLA.},

The LA receives converging inputs from the sensory thalamus and neocortex that are weakened following fear extinction. Combining field and patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings in mice, we show that paired-pulse low-frequency stimulation can induce a robust LTD at thalamic and cortical inputs to LA, and we identify different underlying molecular components at these pathways. We show that while LTD depends on NMDARs and activation of the protein phosphatases PP2B and PP1 at both pathways, it requires NR2B-containing NMDARs at the thalamic pathway, but NR2C/D-containing NMDARs at the cortical pathway. LTD appears to be induced post-synaptically at the thalamic input but presynaptically at the cortical input, since post-synaptic calcium chelation and NMDAR blockade prevent thalamic but not cortical LTD. These results highlight distinct molecular features of LTD in LA that may be relevant for traumatic memory and its erasure, and for pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).},

Nonetheless, surveys of clinical and soil-derived strains reveal penicillin G resistance in 2 to 16\% of isolates tested. Bacterial resistance to \ensuremath{\beta}-lactam agents is often mediated by production of one or more types of \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamases that hydrolyze the \ensuremath{\beta}-lactam ring, inactivating the antimicrobial agent. Here, we report the presence of two \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamase (bla) genes in the penicillin-susceptible Sterne strain of B. anthracis. We identified bla1 by functional cloning with Escherichia coli. bla1 is a 927-nucleotide (nt) gene predicted to encode a protein with 93.8\% identity to the type I \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamase gene of Bacillus cereus. A second gene, bla2, was identified by searching the unfinished B. anthracis chromosome sequence database of The Institute for Genome Research for open reading frames (ORFs) predicted to encode \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamases. We found a partial ORF predicted to encode a protein with significant similarity to the carboxy-terminal end of the type II \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamase of B. cereus. DNA adjacent to the 5\ensuremath{'} end of the partial ORF was cloned using inverse PCR. bla2 is a 768-nt gene predicted to encode a protein with 92\% identity to the B. cereus type II enzyme. The bla1 and bla2 genes confer ampicillin resistance to E. coli and Bacillus subtilis when cloned individually in these species. The MICs of various antimicrobial agents for the E. coli clones indicate that the two \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamase genes confer different susceptibility profiles to E. coli; bla1 is a penicillinase, while bla2 appears to be a cephalosporinase. The \ensuremath{\beta}-galactosidase activities of B. cereus group species harboring bla promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusions indicate that bla1 is poorly transcribed in B. anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis. The bla2 gene is strongly expressed in B. cereus and B. thuringiensis and weakly expressed in B. anthracis. Taken together, these data indicate that the bla1 and bla2 genes of the B. anthracis Sterne strain encode functional \ensuremath{\beta}-lactamases of different types, but gene expression is usually not sufficient to confer resistance to \ensuremath{\beta}-lactam agents.},

After 4 weeks of baseline observations, the men were randomized into two groups: one group received 200 mg testosterone enanthate (TE) weekly by im injection for 8 weeks (Testosterone Only group), the other received placebo injections once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by TE 200 mg weekly for the following 4 weeks (Placebo/Testosterone group). The testosterone administration increased trough plasma testosterone levels by 80\%, compatible with peak testosterone levels 400-500\% above baseline. Various aspects of sexuality were assessed using sexuality experience scales (SES) questionnaires at the end of each 4-week period while sexual activity and mood states were recorded by daily dairies and self-rating scales. In both groups there was a significant increase in scores in the Psychosexual Stimulation Scale of the SES (i.e. SES 2) following testosterone administration, but not with placebo. There were no changes in SES 3, which measures aspects of sexual interaction with the partner. In both groups there were no changes in frequency of sexual intercourse, masturbation, or penile erection on waking nor in any of the moods reported. The Placebo/Testosterone group showed an increase in self-reported interest in sex during testosterone treatment but not with placebo. The SES 2 results suggest that sexual awareness and arousability can be increased by supraphysiological levels of testosterone. However, these changes are not reflected in modifications of overt sexual behavior, which in eugonadal men may be more determined by sexual relationship factors. This contrasts with hypogonadal men, in whom testosterone replacement clearly stimulates sexual behavior. There was no evidence to suggest an alteration in any of the mood states studied, in particular those associated with increased aggression. We conclude that supraphysiological levels of testosterone maintained for up to 2 months can promote some aspects of sexual arousability without stimulating sexual activity in eugonadal men within stable heterosexual relationships. Raising testosterone does not increase self-reported ratings of aggressive feelings.},

About two decades ago a new concept was introduced, namely metaplasticity, which comprises changes that modify the properties of synaptic plasticity due to a priming or preconditioning event. While metaplasticity was initially defined and studied predominantly on a synaptic and cellular level, it soon became apparent that the term could also be very useful to describe plasticity changes on a more global level, including environmental stressors as priming events and altered behavior as outcome measures. We consider here whether it is helpful to conceptualize these latter effects as ``behavioral metaplasticity'', and in which sense this view fits into the original concept of metaplasticity. By integrating the literature on environmental effects on plasticity, especially stress, plus developmental aspects as well as genetic and epigenetic modifications, we shape the framework in which the term ``behavioral metaplasticity'' should be considered and discuss research directions that can help to unravel the mechanisms involved in both synaptic and behavioral metaplasticity.},

The relative proportion of vascular dementia (76 cases; 16\%), Parkinson's disease dementia (30; 6\%), and other dementias (24; 5\%) decreased with age. A substantially higher prevalence of dementia was found in subjects with a low level of education. The association with education was not due to confounding by cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions: The prevalence of dementia increases exponentially with age. About one third of the population aged 85 and over has dementia. Three quarters of all dementia is due to Alzheimer's disease. In this study an inverse dose-response relation was found between education and dementia\textemdash{}in particular, Alzheimer's disease.

  abstract = {The lateral nucleus of the amygdala is the entry point of most sensory inputs into the amygdala. However, the way information is processed and distributed within the lateral nucleus still eludes us. To gain some insight into this issue, we have examined the spatial organization of excitatory and inhibitory connections in the lateral nucleus. To this end, we performed whole-cell recordings of principal lateral amygdala neurons and studied their responses to local pressure applications of glutamate in coronal and horizontal slices of the guinea-pig amygdala. In coronal sections, glutamate puffs performed at a distance from the recorded cells usually evoked inhibitory responses, except when the recorded neuron was adjacent to the external capsule, in which case excitatory responses could be evoked from ejection sites along the external capsule. In contrast, glutamate puffs evoked a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory responses in horizontal slices. Excitatory responses were generally evoked from stimulation sites located lateral to the recorded cell whereas inhibitory responses were commonly elicited from medial stimulation sites, irrespective of their rostrocaudal position. These findings confirm and extend previous tract-tracing studies where it was found that intrinsic connections within the lateral amygdala prevalently run in the dorsoventral and lateromedial directions. However, our results also reveal a hitherto unsuspected level of spatial heterogeneity in the intrinsic circuit of the lateral amygdala. The prevalence of excitatory responses in horizontal slices coupled to the ubiquity of inhibitory responses in coronal slices suggest that the lateral amygdala network is designed to allow associative interactions within the rostrocaudal plane while preventing runaway excitation locally.},

  abstract = {Much attention has been paid to the associative processes that are necessary to fuse together representations of the various components of an episodic memory. In the present study, we focus on the processes involved in the formation of lasting representations of the individual components that make up a fear-conditioning episode. In one-trial contextual fear conditioning experiments, weak conditioning to context occurs if the shock is delivered immediately following placement of the animal in a novel conditioning apparatus, a phenomenon known as the immediate shock deficit. We show that the immediate shock deficit in mice may be alleviated by pre-exposure to either the context or shock. In using this approach to temporally dissect a contextual fear-conditioning task into its constituent representational and associative processes, we are able to examine directly the processes that are important for formation of lasting representations of the context conditioned stimulus (CS) or unconditioned stimulus (US). Our data indicate that the formation of a lasting representation of the context or shock engages protein synthesis-dependent processes. Furthermore, genetic disruption of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of new proteins required for long-term memory, disrupts the formation of lasting context memories. We go on to show that the stress hormone epinephrine modulates the consolidation of a context memory, and reverses consolidation deficits in the CREB-deficient mice. Finally we show that disrupting either NMDA or calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) function impairs consolidation of context memories. Together, these data suggest that this approach is particularly suited for the characterization of molecular and cellular processes underlying the formation of stimulus representations.},

In contrast, intersubject differences that emerge within groups are difficult to study systematically and are often excluded from scientific discussion. Nevertheless, population-wide variability is a virtually universal feature of both complex traits, such as intelligence, and hardwired responses, such as defensive behaviors. Here, we use outbred rats to investigate if cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that has long been known in experimental settings to be crucial for associative plasticity, participates in natural memory phenotypes. Using a combination of behavioral, biochemical, and viral techniques, we show that a subset of rats with trait-like deficits in aversive memory have basally reduced CREB activity in the lateral amygdala but can be induced to perform at average levels by directly or indirectly enhancing pretraining CREB phosphorylation. These data suggest that endogenous CREB activity in the amygdala may set a critical threshold for plasticity during memory formation.},

In the current study, the authors trained older adults in a real-time strategy video game for 23.5 hr in an effort to improve their executive functions. A battery of cognitive tasks, including tasks of executive control and visuospatial skills, were assessed before, during, and after video-game training. The trainees improved significantly in the measures of game performance. They also improved significantly more than the control participants in executive control functions, such as task switching, working memory, visual short-term memory, and reasoning. Individual differences in changes in game performance were correlated with improvements in task switching.

Neither pregnenolone (40 mg/kg/day), a precursor of DHEA, nor androstenediol (40 mg/kg/day), a major metabolite, replicated the effect of DHEA (40 mg/kg/day). Corticosterone reduced the number of cells labelled with a marker for neurons (NeuN) following a 28-day survival period, and this was also prevented by DHEA. DHEA by itself increased the number of newly formed neurons, but only if treatment was continued throughout the period of survival. Subcutaneous DHEA pellets stimulated neurogenesis in a small number of older rats (\ensuremath{\approx} 12 months old). These results show that DHEA, a steroid prominent in the blood and cerebral environment of humans, but which decreases markedly with age and during major depressive disorder, regulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus and modulates the inhibitory effect of increased corticoids on both the formation of new neurons and their survival.},

  abstract = {The ventral pallidum (VP) is a key structure in brain mesocorticolimbic reward circuits that mediate "liking" reactions to sensory pleasures. Do firing patterns in VP actually code sensory pleasure? Strong evidence for hedonic coding requires showing that neural signals track positive increases in sensory pleasure or even reversals from bad to good. A useful test is the salt alliesthesia of physiological sodium depletion that makes even aversively intense NaCl taste become palatable and "liked." We compared VP neural firing activity in rats during aversive "disliking" reactions elicited by a noxiously intense NaCl taste (triple-seawater 1.5 M concentration) in normal homeostatic state versus in a physiological salt appetite state that made the same NaCl taste palatable and elicit positive "liking" reactions. We also compared firing elicited by palatable sucrose taste, which always elicited "liking" reactions in both states. A dramatic doubling in the amplitude of VP neural firing peaks to NaCl was caused by salt appetite that matched the affective switch from aversive ("disliking") to positive hedonic ("liking") reactions. By contrast, VP neural activity to "liked" sucrose taste was always high and never altered. In summary, VP firing activity selectively tracks the hedonic values of tastes, even across hedonic reversals caused by physiological changes. Our data provide the strongest evidence yet for neural hedonic coding of natural sensory pleasures and suggest, by extension, how abnormalities in VP firing patterns might contribute to clinical hedonic dysfunctions.},

  abstract = {Febrile seizures (FSs) constitute the most prevalent seizure type during childhood. Whether prolonged FSs alter limbic excitability, leading to spontaneous seizures (temporal lobe epilepsy) during adulthood, has been controversial. Recent data indicate that, in the immature rat model, prolonged FSs induce transient structural changes of some hippocampal pyramidal neurons and long-term functional changes of hippocampal circuitry. However, whether these neuroanatomical and electrophysiological changes promote hippocampal excitability and lead to epilepsy has remained unknown. By using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we determined that prolonged hyperthermia-induced seizures in immature rats caused long-term enhanced susceptibility to limbic convulsants that lasted to adulthood. Thus, extensive hippocampal electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring failed to demonstrate spontaneous seizures in adult rats that had experienced hyperthermic seizures during infancy. However, 100\% of animals developed hippocampal seizures after systemic administration of a low dose of kainate, and most progressed to status epilepticus. Conversely, a minority of normothermic and hyperthermic controls had (brief) seizures, none developing status epilepticus. In vitro, spontaneous epileptiform discharges were not observed in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices derived from either control or experimental groups. However, Schaeffer collateral stimulation induced prolonged, self-sustaining, status epilepticus-like discharges exclusively in slices from experimental rats. These data indicate that hyperthermic seizures in the immature rat model of FSs do not cause spontaneous limbic seizures during adulthood. However, they reduce thresholds to chemical convulsants in vivo and electrical stimulation in vitro, indicating persistent enhancement of limbic excitability that may facilitate the development of epilepsy.},

These enzymes were much less concentrated in the cortical, medial, central, and basomedial nuclei. Large differences in acetylcholinesterase staining were found within the lateral posterior and the basolateral nuclei and within the pyriform cortex.

  abstract = {Biochemical, electrophysiological, and imaging studies suggest that the anterior part of the insular cortex (IC) serves as primary taste cortex, whereas fMRI studies in human propose that the anterior IC is also involved in processing of general novelty or saliency information. Here, we compared activity regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (Arc)/Arg3.1 protein levels in the rat IC following administration of familiar versus novel tastes. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between novel taste and Arc/Arg3.1 levels when measured as the sum of both left and right insular cortices. However, when left and right IC were examined separately, Arc/Arg3.1 level was lateralized following novel taste learning. Moreover, Arc/Arg3.1 lateralization was inversely correlated with taste familiarity, whereas the high lateralization of Arc/Arg3.1 expression observed following novel taste learning is reduced proportionally to the increment in taste familiarity. In addition, unilateral inhibition of protein synthesis in the IC had asymmetrical effect on memory, inducing strong memory impairment similarly to bilateral inhibition or memory preservation, indicating that hemispheric lateralization is central for processing taste saliency information. These results provide indications, at the gene level of expression, for the role of IC lateralization in processing novel taste information and for the asymmetrical contribution of protein synthesis in each hemisphere during memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {Certain maladaptive behaviors are thought to be acquired through classical Pavlovian conditioning. Exaggerated fear response, which can develop through Pavlovian conditioning, is associated with acquired anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs). Inflated reward-seeking behavior, which develops through Pavlovian conditioning, underlies some types of addictive behavior (e.g., addiction to drugs, food, and gambling). These maladaptive behaviors are dependent on associative learning and the development of long-term memory (LTM). In animal models, an aversive reinforcer (fear conditioning) encodes an aversive contextual and cued LTM. On the other hand, an appetitive reinforcer results in conditioned place preference (CPP) that encodes an appetitive contextual LTM. The literature on weak and strong associative learning pertaining to the development of aversive and appetitive LTM is relatively scarce; thus, this review is particularly focused on the strength of associative learning. The strength of associative learning is dependent on the valence of the reinforcer and the salience of the conditioned stimulus that ultimately sways the strength of the memory trace. Our studies suggest that labile (weak) aversive and appetitive LTM may share similar signaling pathways, whereas stable (strong) aversive and appetitive LTM is mediated through different pathways. In addition, we provide some evidence suggesting that extinction of aversive fear memory and appetitive drug memory is likely to be mediated through different signaling molecules. We put forward the importance of studies aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of weak and strong memories (aversive and appetitive), which would ultimately help in the development of targeted pharmacotherapies for the management of maladaptive behaviors that arise from classical Pavlovian conditioning.},

  abstract = {Refinement of neural circuits in the mammalian cerebral cortex shapes brain function during development and in the adult. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying the synapse-specific shrinkage and loss of spiny synapses when neural circuits are remodeled remain poorly defined. Here, we show that low-frequency glutamatergic activity at individual dendritic spines leads to synapse-specific synaptic weakening and spine shrinkage on CA1 neurons in the hippocampus. We found that shrinkage of individual spines in response to low-frequency glutamate uncaging is saturable, reversible, and requires NMDA receptor activation. Notably, shrinkage of large spines additionally requires signaling through metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs), supported by higher levels of mGluR signaling activity in large spines. Our results support a model in which signaling through both NMDA receptors and mGluRs is required to drive activity-dependent synaptic weakening and spine shrinkage at large, mature dendritic spines when neural circuits undergo experience-dependent modification.},

  doi = {10.2147/NDT.S23159},
  abstract = {We reviewed 143 papers that described the relationship between moderate drinking of alcohol and some aspect of cognition. Two types of papers were found: (1) those that provided ratios of risk between drinkers and nondrinkers (74 papers in total) and (2) those that, although they did not provide such ratios, allowed cognition in drinkers to be rated as "better," "no different," or "worse" than cognition in nondrinkers (69 papers in total). The history of research on moderate drinking and cognition can be divided into two eras: 1977-1997 and 1998-present. Phase I (1977-1997) was the era of neuropsychological evaluation involving mostly young to middle-aged (18-50 years old) subjects. Although initial studies indicated moderate drinking impaired cognition, many later studies failed to confirm this, instead finding no difference in cognition between drinkers and nondrinkers. Phase II (1998-present) was and is the era of mental status exam evaluation involving mostly older (\ensuremath{\geq}55 years old) subjects. These studies overwhelmingly found that moderate drinking either reduced or had no effect on the risk of dementia or cognitive impairment. When all the ratios of risk from all the studies in phase II providing such ratios are entered into a comprehensive meta-analysis, the average ratio of risk for cognitive risk (dementia or cognitive impairment/decline) associated with moderate "social" (not alcoholic) drinking of alcohol is 0.77, with nondrinkers as the reference group. The benefit of moderate drinking applied to all forms of dementia (dementia unspecified, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia) and to cognitive impairment (low test scores), but no significant benefit against cognitive decline (rate of decline in test scores) was found. Both light and moderate drinking provided a similar benefit, but heavy drinking was associated with nonsignificantly higher cognitive risk for dementia and cognitive impairment. Although the meta-analysis also indicated that wine was better than beer or spirits, this was based on a relatively small number of studies because most studies did not distinguish among these different types of alcohol. Furthermore, a number of the studies that did make the distinction reported no difference among the effects of these different types of alcohol. Therefore, at present this question remains unanswered. Analysis also showed that the presence of the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele eliminated the benefit of moderate drinking. However, this was based on a relatively small number of studies and several other studies have found a beneficial effect of the epsilon e4 allele. Further studies are necessary to settle this question. The benefit of moderate alcohol for cognition was seen in both men and women, although the amount and pattern of drinking is very different between the two sexes. Lastly, the finding of unaffected or significantly reduced cognitive risk in light to moderate drinkers was seen in 14/19 countries for which country-specific ratio data were available, with three of the five remaining countries showing nonsignificant reductions as well. Overall, light to moderate drinking does not appear to impair cognition in younger subjects and actually seems to reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline in older subjects.},

While often electrophysiological manipulations are used to demonstrate this phenomenon, prior behavioral manipulations such as exposure to stress were also found to affect the ability to induce LTP and LTD. Interestingly, amygdala stimulation was found to have effects on subsequent LTP induction that resemble those of stress. Here, we report that exposure to stress or basolateral amygdala (BLA) stimulation induces a form of metaplasticity, which prevents the ability of a second episode of stress or BLA activation to suppress LTP in the ventral hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathway. This form of metaplasticity is N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-dependent since the injection of the NMDA partial agonist D-cycloserine prevented the inhibition of LTP induced by prior exposure of stress or BLA activation. Furthermore, blocking NMDA receptors by MK801 before the exposure to stress prevented the ability of the emotional manipulation to inhibit the subsequent modulation of plasticity, resulting in impaired LTP in the mPFC. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a new form of NMDA-dependent emotional metaplasticity in the ventral hippocampus-mPFC pathway.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.brs.2012.09.010},
  abstract = {Background
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces long-lasting NMDA receptor-dependent cortical plasticity via persistent subthreshold polarization of neuronal membranes. Conventional bipolar tDCS is applied with two large (35~cm2) rectangular electrodes, resulting in directional modulation of neuronal excitability. Recently a newly designed 4~\texttimes{}~1 high-definition (HD) tDCS protocol was proposed for more focal stimulation according to the results of computational modeling. HD tDCS utilizes small disc electrodes deployed in 4~\texttimes{}~1 ring configuration whereby the physiological effects of the induced electric field are thought to be grossly constrained to the cortical area circumscribed by the ring.
Objective
We aim to compare the physiological effects of both tDCS electrode arrangements on motor cortex excitability.
Methods
tDCS was applied with 2~mA for 10~min. Fourteen healthy subjects participated, and motor cortex excitability was monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after tDCS.
Results
Excitability enhancement following anodal and a respective reduction after cathodal stimulation occurred in both, conventional and HD tDCS. However, the plastic changes showed a more delayed peak at 30~min and longer lasting after-effects for more than 2~h after HD tDCS for both polarities, as compared to conventional tDCS.
Conclusion
The results show that this new electrode arrangement is efficient for the induction of neuroplasticity in the primary motor cortex. The pattern of aftereffects might be compatible with the concept of GABA-mediated surround inhibition, which should be explored in future studies directly.},

  abstract = {Touch sensitivity in animals relies on nerve endings in the skin that convert mechanical force into electrical signals. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, gentle touch to the body wall is sensed by six mechanosensory neurons that express two amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel proteins (DEG/ENaC). These proteins, MEC-4 and MEC-10, are required for touch sensation and can mutate to cause neuronal degeneration. Here we show that these mutant or 'd' forms of MEC-4 and MEC-10 produce a constitutively active, amiloride-sensitive ionic current when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but not on their own. MEC-2, a stomatin-related protein needed for touch sensitivity, increased the activity of mutant channels about 40-fold and allowed currents to be detected with wild-type MEC-4 and MEC-10. Whereas neither the central, stomatin-like domain of MEC-2 nor human stomatin retained the activity of full-length MEC-2, both produced amiloride-sensitive currents with MEC-4d. Our findings indicate that MEC-2 regulates MEC-4/MEC-10 ion channels and raise the possibility that similar ion channels may be formed by stomatin-like proteins and DEG/ENaC proteins that are co-expressed in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Some of these channels may mediate mechanosensory responses.},

  abstract = {Learning is believed to depend on lasting changes in synaptic efficacy such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression. As a result, a profusion of studies has tried to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these forms of plasticity. Traditionally, experience-dependent changes at excitatory synapses were assumed to underlie learning and memory formation. However, with the relatively more recent investigation of inhibitory transmission, it had become evident that inhibitory synapses are not only plastic, but also provide an additional way to modulate excitatory transmission and the induction of plasticity at excitatory synapses. Thanks to recent technological advances, progress has been made in understanding synaptic transmission and plasticity from particular interneuron subtypes. In this review article, we will describe various forms of synaptic plasticity that have been ascribed to two fairly well characterized populations of interneurons in the hippocampus, those expressing cholecystokinin (CCK) and parvalbumin (PV). We will discuss the resulting changes in the strength and plasticity of excitatory transmission that occur in the local circuit as a result of the modulation of inhibitory transmission. We will focus on the hippocampus because this region has a relatively well-understood circuitry, numerous forms of activity-dependent plasticity and a multitude of identified interneuron subclasses.},

The use of the term 'stress' to conditions ranging from even the mildest challenging stimulation to severely aversive conditions, is in our view inappropriate. Review of the literature reveals that the physiological 'stress' response to appetitive, rewarding stimuli that are often not considered to be stressors can be as large as the response to negative stimuli. Analysis of the physiological response during exercise supports the view that the magnitude of the neuroendocrine response reflects the metabolic and physiological demands required for behavioural activity. We propose that the term 'stress' should be restricted to conditions where an environmental demand exceeds the natural regulatory capacity of an organism, in particular situations that include unpredictability and uncontrollability. Physiologically, stress seems to be characterized by either the absence of an anticipatory response (unpredictable) or a reduced recovery (uncontrollable) of the neuroendocrine reaction. The consequences of this restricted definition for stress research and the interpretation of results in terms of the adaptive and/or maladaptive nature of the response are discussed.},

We subsequently created lines of telomerase-immortalized human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells stably expressing all five family members and found that each one faithfully recapitulated the signaling phenotype of the parent receptor. We also expressed a G(i)-coupled designer receptor in hippocampal neurons (hM(4)D) and demonstrated its ability to induce membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal silencing. We have thus devised a facile approach for designing families of GPCRs with engineered ligand specificities.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by early reductions in glucose transport associated with diminished GLUT1 expression at the BBB. Whether GLUT1 reduction influences disease pathogenesis remains, however, elusive. Here we show that GLUT1 deficiency in mice overexpressing amyloid \ensuremath{\beta}-peptide (A\ensuremath{\beta}) precursor protein leads to early cerebral microvascular degeneration, blood flow reductions and dysregulation and BBB breakdown, and to accelerated amyloid \ensuremath{\beta}-peptide (A\ensuremath{\beta}) pathology, reduced A\ensuremath{\beta} clearance, diminished neuronal activity, behavioral deficits, and progressive neuronal loss and neurodegeneration that develop after initial cerebrovascular degenerative changes. We also show that GLUT1 deficiency in endothelium, but not in astrocytes, initiates the vascular phenotype as shown by BBB breakdown. Thus, reduced BBB GLUT1 expression worsens Alzheimer's disease cerebrovascular degeneration, neuropathology and cognitive function, suggesting that GLUT1 may represent a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease vasculo-neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.},

  abstract = {Severe stress or trauma can cause permanent changes in brain circuitry, leading to dysregulation of fear responses and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying stress-induced long-term plasticity in fear circuits. We addressed this question by using global gene expression profiling in an animal model of PTSD, stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL). A total of 15 footshocks were used to induce SEFL and the volatile anesthetic isoflurane was used to suppress the behavioral effects of stress. Gene expression in lateral/basolateral amygdala was measured using microarrays at 3 weeks after the exposure to different combinations of shock and isoflurane. Shock produced robust effects on amygdalar transcriptome and isoflurane blocked or reversed many of the stress-induced changes. We used a modular approach to molecular profiles of shock and isoflurane and built a network of regulated genes, functional categories, and cell types that represent a mechanistic foundation of perturbation-induced plasticity in the amygdala. This analysis partitioned perturbation-induced changes in gene expression into neuron- and astrocyte-specific changes, highlighting a previously underappreciated role of astroglia in amygdalar plasticity. Many neuron-enriched genes were highly correlated with astrocyte-enriched genes, suggesting coordinated transcriptional responses to environmental challenges in these cell types. Several individual genes were validated using RT-PCR and behavioral pharmacology. This study is the first to propose specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SEFL, an animal model of PTSD, and to nominate novel molecular and cellular targets with potential for therapeutic intervention in PTSD, including glycine and neuropeptide systems, chromatin remodeling, and gliotransmission.},

However, it is not known whether cortical projection neurons that target different subcortical nuclei have distinct dendritic morphologies. In this study, fast blue retrograde tracing in combination with intracellular Lucifer yellow injection and diaminobenzidine (DAB) photoconversion in fixed slices was used to study the morphological features of corticospinal, corticostriatal, and corticothalamic neurons in layer V of rat motor cortex. Marked differences in the distribution of soma, somal size, and dendritic profiles were found among the three groups of pyramidal neurons. Corticospinal neurons were large, were located in deep layer V, and had the most expansive dendritic fields. The apical dendrites of corticospinal pyramidal neurons were thick, spiny, and branched. In contrast, nearly all corticostriatal neurons were small cells located in superficial layer V. Their apical dendritic shafts were significantly more slender, though spiny like those of corticospinal neurons. Corticothalamic neurons, which were located in superficial layer V and in layer VI, had small or medium-sized soma, slender apical dendritic shafts, and dendrites that were largely spine free. This study indicates that, in layer V of rat motor cortex, each population of projection neurons has a unique somatodendritic morphology and suggests that distinct modes of cortical information processing are operative in corticospinal, corticostriatal, and corticothalamic neurons.},

  abstract = {In cortical networks, different types of inhibitory interneurons control the activity of glutamatergic principal cells and GABAergic interneurons. Principal neurons represent the major postsynaptic target of most interneurons; however, a population of interneurons that is dedicated to the selective innervation of GABAergic cells exists in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. The physiological properties of these cells and their functional relevance for network computations remain unknown. Here, we used a combination of dual simultaneous patch-clamp recordings and targeted optogenetic stimulation in acute mouse hippocampal slices to examine how one class of interneuron-specific (IS) cells controls the activity of its GABAergic targets. We found that type 3 IS (IS3) cells that coexpress the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and calretinin contact several distinct types of interneurons within the hippocampal CA1 stratum oriens/alveus (O/A), with preferential innervation of oriens-lacunosum moleculare cells (OLMs) through dendritic synapses. In contrast, VIP-positive basket cells provided perisomatic inhibition to CA1 pyramidal neurons with the asynchronous GABA release and were not connected with O/A interneurons. Furthermore, unitary IPSCs recorded at IS3\textendash{}OLM synapses had a small amplitude and low release probability but summated efficiently during high-frequency firing of IS3 interneurons. Moreover, the synchronous generation of a single spike in several IS cells that converged onto a single OLM controlled the firing rate and timing of OLM interneurons. Therefore, dendritic inhibition originating from IS cells is needed for the flexible activity-dependent recruitment of OLM interneurons for feedback inhibition.},

However, anxiety disorders, such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), can occur when fear is inappropriately regulated. Fear conditioning can be used to study aspects of PTSD, and we have developed a model in which pre-exposure to a stressor of repeated footshock enhances conditional fear responding to a single context-shock pairing. The experiments in this chapter address interpretations of this effect including generalization and summation or fear, inflation, and altered pain sensitivity. The results of these experiments lead to the conclusion that pre-exposure to shock sensitizes conditional fear responding to similar less intense stressors. This sensitization effect resists exposure therapy (extinction) and amnestic (NMDA antagonist) treatment. The pattern predicts why in PTSD patients, mild stressors cause reactions more appropriate for the original traumatic stressor and why new fears are so readily formed in these patients. This model can facilitate the study of neurobiological mechanisms underlying sensitization of responses observed in PTSD.},

  abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique to modulate cortical excitability. Although increased/decreased excitability under the anode/cathode electrode is nominally associated with membrane depolarization/hyperpolarization, which cellular compartments (somas, dendrites, axons and their terminals) mediate changes in cortical excitability remains unaddressed. Here we consider the acute effects of DCS on excitatory synaptic efficacy. Using multi-scale computational models and rat cortical brain slices, we show the following. (1) Typical tDCS montages produce predominantly tangential (relative to the cortical surface) direction currents (4-12 times radial direction currents), even directly under electrodes. (2) Radial current flow (parallel to the somatodendritic axis) modulates synaptic efficacy consistent with somatic polarization, with depolarization facilitating synaptic efficacy. (3) Tangential current flow (perpendicular to the somatodendritic axis) modulates synaptic efficacy acutely (during stimulation) in an afferent pathway-specific manner that is consistent with terminal polarization, with hyperpolarization facilitating synaptic efficacy. (4) Maximal polarization during uniform DCS is expected at distal (the branch length is more than three times the membrane length constant) synaptic terminals, independent of and two-three times more susceptible than pyramidal neuron somas. We conclude that during acute DCS the cellular targets responsible for modulation of synaptic efficacy are concurrently somata and axon terminals, with the direction of cortical current flow determining the relative influence.},

  abstract = {Memory consolidation, the process of transformation of short-term to long-term memory, has been shown to be protein synthesis dependent in a variety of different learning paradigms, brain structures, and species. At the cellular level, protein synthesis was shown to be crucial for induction of long-term synaptic plasticity; application of protein synthesis inhibitors prevents the transformation of early long-term potentiation (LTP) to late LTP. Thus, protein synthesis has been traditionally thought to affect long-term memory consolidation by stabilizing synaptic transmission. However, long-term memory is not supported only by modulation of synaptic strength; modifications in intrinsic neuronal properties also subserve learning-related behavioral changes. Learning-induced reduction in the postburst afterhyperpolarization (AHP), which results with enhanced neuronal excitability and decreased spike frequency adaptation, is apparent in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons. Such postburst AHP reduction lasts for days after training completion and is implicated in maintaining learned skills. Short-term modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability can be also induced in vitro. Intense synaptic activation induces AHP reduction and enhanced neuronal excitability in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Here, we show that synaptic activation-induced short-term postburst AHP reduction can be transformed to long-term AHP reduction, such that persists for prolonged time periods. This long-lasting AHP reduction is protein synthesis dependent for up to 1 h after induction. We suggest that, much like synaptic plasticity, activity-induced long-lasting modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability requires molecular consolidation. It would appear that both synaptic and intrinsic modifications and maintenance are activated jointly to enable long-lasting memories.},

  abstract = {After fear conditioning, presenting the conditioned stimulus (CS) alone yields a context-specific extinction memory; fear is suppressed in the extinction context, but renews in any other context. The context-dependence of extinction is mediated by a brain circuit consisting of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala. In the present work, we sought to determine at what level of this circuit context-dependent representations of the CS emerge. To explore this question, we used cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescent in situ hybridization (catFISH). This method exploits the intracellular expression profile of the immediate early gene (IEG), Arc, to visualize neuronal activation patterns to two different behavioral experiences. Rats were fear conditioned in one context and extinguished in another; 24 h later, they were sequentially exposed to the CS in the extinction context and another context. Control rats were also tested in each context, but were never extinguished. We assessed Arc mRNA expression within the basal amygdala (BA), lateral amygdala (LA), ventral hippocampus (VH), prelimbic cortex (PL) and infralimbic cortex (IL). We observed that the sequential retention tests induced context-dependent patterns of Arc expression in the BA, LA, and IL of extinguished rats; this was not observed in non-extinguished controls. In general, non-extinguished animals had proportionately greater numbers of non-selective (double-labeled) neurons than extinguished animals. Collectively, these findings suggest that extinction learning results in pattern separation, particularly within the BA, in which unique neuronal ensembles represent fear memories after extinction.},

Consequences of seizures in the developing brain are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term alterations of synaptic transmission and seizure susceptibility in the hippocampus after early-life seizures induced by systemic injection of a GABAB-receptor antagonist CGP56999A in immature rats. Experimental rats were injected with CGP56999A 1\textendash{}1.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) on postnatal day 15, while controls were injected with saline i.p. Seizures induced by CGP56999A originated mostly from the hippocampus and amygdala, and were associated with no mortality. Thirty days after seizures, laminar field potentials were recorded in the hippocampus in urethane-anesthetized rats by 16-channel silicon probes and analyzed as current source density. As compared to early-life saline-injected rats, early-life CGP56999A-induced seizure rats showed a significant decrease in paired-pulse inhibition of population spikes at 150\textendash{}400 ms interpulse intervals (IPIs) in CA1, following CA3 stimulation, and at 400 ms IPI in the dentate gyrus, following medial perforant path stimulation. In a separate experiment, adolescent rats that experienced CGP56999A-induced early-life seizures showed a robust facilitation of hippocampal kindling, as compared to saline controls. In conclusion, seizures induced by GABAB-receptor blockade in immature rats resulted in a long-lasting loss of GABAB-receptor mediated paired-pulse inhibition in CA1 and dentate gyrus, which may contribute to the increase of seizure susceptibility in the hippocampus.},

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), one of the most widely used mindfulness training programs, has been reported to produce positive effects on psychological well-being and to ameliorate symptoms of a number of disorders. Here, we report a controlled longitudinal study to investigate pre-post changes in brain gray matter concentration attributable to participation in an MBSR program. Anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images from 16 healthy, meditation-na{\"\i}ve participants were obtained before and after they underwent the 8-week program. Changes in gray matter concentration were investigated using voxel-based morphometry, and compared with a waiting list control group of 17 individuals. Analyses in a priori regions of interest confirmed increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus. Whole brain analyses identified increases in the posterior cingulate cortex, the temporo-parietal junction, and the cerebellum in the MBSR group compared with the controls. The results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.},

Here we show in the cortico-amygdala pathway that learned fear occludes electrically induced long-term potentiation (LTP). Quantal analysis of the expression of LTP in this pathway reveals a significant presynaptic component reflected in an increase in probability of transmitter release. Conditioned fear also is accompanied by the enhancement in transmitter release at this cortico-amygdala synapse. These results indicate that the synaptic projections from the auditory cortex to the lateral amygdala are modified during the acquisition and expression of fear to auditory stimulation, thus further strengthening the proposed link between LTP in the auditory pathways to the amygdala and learned fear.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Marijuana and alcohol are most widely abused drugs among women of reproductive age. Neurocognitive deficits have been reported in children whose mothers used marijuana during pregnancy. Maternal consumption of ethanol is known to cause serious developmental deficits
METHODS: Infant rats and mice received systemic injections of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 1-10mg/kg) or the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (1-10mg/kg), alone or in combination with subtoxic and toxic ethanol doses, and apoptotic neurodegeneration was studied in the brains
RESULTS: Acute administration of THC (1-10mg/kg), the principal psychoactive cannabinoid of marijuana, markedly enhanced proapoptotic properties of ethanol in the neonatal rat brain. THC did not induce neurodegeneration when administered alone. Neuronal degeneration became disseminated and severe when THC was combined with a mildly intoxicating ethanol dose (3gm/kg), with the effect of this drug combination resembling the massive apoptotic death observed when administering ethanol alone at much higher doses. The detrimental effect of THC was mimicked by the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (1-10mg/kg) and counteracted by the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.4mg/kg). THC enhanced the proapoptotic effect of the GABA(A) agonist phenobarbital and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine. Interestingly, infant CB(1) receptor knock-out mice were less susceptible to the neurotoxic effect of ethanol. Furthermore, the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A ameliorated neurotoxicity of ethanol
INTERPRETATION: These observations indicate that CB(1) receptor activation modulates GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission and primes the developing brain to suffer apoptotic neuronal death.},

We developed a new assay for investigating the motivational properties of ethanol in the genetically tractable model Drosophila melanogaster. Flies learned to associate cues with ethanol intoxication and, although transiently aversive, the experience led to a long-lasting attraction for the ethanol-paired cue, implying that intoxication is rewarding. Temporally blocking transmission in dopaminergic neurons revealed that flies require activation of these neurons to express, but not develop, conditioned preference for ethanol-associated cues. Moreover, flies acquired, consolidated and retrieved these rewarding memories using distinct sets of neurons in the mushroom body. Finally, mutations in scabrous, encoding a fibrinogen-related peptide that regulates Notch signaling, disrupted the formation of memories for ethanol reward. Our results thus establish that Drosophila can be useful for understanding the molecular, genetic and neural mechanisms underling the rewarding properties of ethanol.},

  abstract = {Learning-induced modulation of neuronal intrinsic excitability is a metaplasticity mechanism that can impact the acquisition of new memories. Although the amygdala is important for emotional learning and other behaviors, including fear and anxiety, whether learning alters intrinsic excitability within the amygdala has received very little attention. Fear conditioning was combined with intracellular recordings to investigate the effects of learning on the intrinsic excitability of lateral amygdala (LA) neurons. To assess time-dependent changes, brain slices were prepared either immediately or 24-h post-conditioning. Fear conditioning significantly enhanced excitability of LA neurons, as evidenced by both decreased afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and increased neuronal firing. These changes were time-dependent such that reduced AHPs were evident at both time points whereas increased neuronal firing was only observed at the later (24-h) time point. Moreover, these changes occurred within a subset (32\%) of LA neurons. Previous work also demonstrated that learning-related changes in synaptic plasticity are also evident in less than one-third of amygdala neurons, suggesting that the neurons undergoing intrinsic plasticity may be critical for fear memory. These data may be clinically relevant as enhanced LA excitability following fear learning could influence future amygdala-dependent behaviors.},

Their peculiar shape suggests that spines can serve as an autonomous postsynaptic compartment that isolates chemical and electrical signaling. How neuronal activity modifies the morphology of the spine and how these modifications affect synaptic transmission and plasticity are intriguing issues. Indeed, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD) is associated with the enlargement or shrinkage of the spine, respectively. This structural plasticity is mainly controlled by actin filaments, the principal cytoskeletal component of the spine. Here we review the pioneering microscopic studies examining the structural plasticity of spines and propose how changes in actin treadmilling might regulate spine morphology.},

Therefore, we compared the currently available literature on the global analysis of gene expression following epileptogenic insult to search for (i) highly represented functional gene classes (GO terms) within data sets, and (ii) individual genes that appear in several data sets, and therefore, might be of particular importance for the development of epilepsy due to different etiologies. We focused on two well-described models of brain insult that induce the development of spontaneous seizures in experimental animals: status epilepticus and traumatic brain injury. Additionally, a few papers describing gene expression in rat and human epileptic tissue were included for comparison. Our analysis revealed that epileptogenic insults induce significant changes in gene expression within a subset of pre-defined GO terms, that is, in groups of functionally linked genes. We also found individual genes for which expression changed across different models of epileptogenesis. Alterations in gene expression appear time-specific and underlie a number of processes that are linked with epileptogenesis, such as cell death and survival, neuronal plasticity, or immune response. Particularly, our analysis highlighted alterations in gene expression in glial cells as well as in genes involved in the immune response, which suggests the importance of gliosis and immune reaction in epileptogenesis.},

  abstract = {A specific memory is thought to be encoded by a sparse population of neurons. These neurons can be tagged during learning for subsequent identification and manipulation. Moreover, their ablation or inactivation results in reduced memory expression, suggesting their necessity in mnemonic processes. However, the question of sufficiency remains: it is unclear whether it is possible to elicit the behavioural output of a specific memory by directly activating a population of neurons that was active during learning. Here we show in mice that optogenetic reactivation of hippocampal neurons activated during fear conditioning is sufficient to induce freezing behaviour. We labelled a population of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons activated during fear learning with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and later optically reactivated these neurons in a different context. The mice showed increased freezing only upon light stimulation, indicating light-induced fear memory recall. This freezing was not detected in non-fear-conditioned mice expressing ChR2 in a similar proportion of cells, nor in fear-conditioned mice with cells labelled by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein instead of ChR2. Finally, activation of cells labelled in a context not associated with fear did not evoke freezing in mice that were previously fear conditioned in a different context, suggesting that light-induced fear memory recall is context specific. Together, our findings indicate that activating a sparse but specific ensemble of hippocampal neurons that contribute to a memory engram is sufficient for the recall of that memory. Moreover, our experimental approach offers a general method of mapping cellular populations bearing memory engrams.},

  abstract = {A variety of acute brain insults bear the risk of subsequent development of chronic epilepsy. Enhanced understanding of the brain alterations underlying this process may ultimately lead to interventions that prevent, interrupt or reverse epileptogenesis in people at risk. Various interventions have been evaluated in rat models of symptomatic epilepsy, in which epileptogenesis was induced by status epilepticus (SE) or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Paradoxically, recent data indicated that administration of proconvulsant drugs after TBI or SE exerts antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying effects, although epilepsy is often considered to represent a decrease in seizure threshold. Surprisingly, to our knowledge, it is not known whether alterations in seizure threshold occur during the latent period following SE. This prompted us to study seizure threshold during and after the latent period following SE induced by lithium/pilocarpine in rats. Timed intravenous infusion of the GABAA receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) was used for this purpose. The duration of the latent period was determined by continuous video/EEG monitoring. Compared to control seizure threshold determined before SE, threshold significantly decreased two days after SE, but returned to pre-SE control thereafter. Moreover, the duration of PTZ-induced seizures was significantly increased throughout the latent period, which ranged from 6 to 10 days after SE. This increased susceptibility to PTZ likely reflects the complex alterations in GABA-mediated transmission that occur during the latent period following SE. The data will allow developing dosing regimens for evaluation of whether treatment with subconvulsant doses of PTZ during the latent period affects the development of epilepsy.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
Episodic memories are encoded within hippocampal and neocortical circuits. Retrieving these memories is assumed to involve reactivation of neural ensembles that were established during learning. Although it has been possible to follow the activity of individual neurons shortly after learning, it has not been possible to examine their activity weeks later during retrieval. We addressed this issue by using a stable form of GFP (H2B-GFP) to permanently tag neurons that are active during contextual fear conditioning.
Results
H2B-GFP expression in transgenic mice was increased by learning and could be regulated by doxycycline (DOX). Using this system, we found a large network of neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex that were active during context fear conditioning and subsequent memory retrieval 2~days later. Reactivation was contingent on memory retrieval and was not observed when animals were trained and tested in different environments. When memory was retrieved several weeks after learning, reactivation was altered in the hippocampus and amygdala but remained unchanged in the cortex.
Conclusions
Retrieving a recently formed context fear memory reactivates neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. Several weeks after learning, the degree of reactivation is altered in hippocampal and amygdala networks but remains stable in the cortex.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: tDCS is a promising novel therapeutic intervention for major depression (MD). However, clinical trials to date have reported conflicting results concerning its efficacy, which likely resulted from low statistical power. Thus, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized, double-blind and controlled trials of tDCS in MD with a focus on clinically relevant outcomes, namely response and remission rates.
METHOD: We searched the literature for English language randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) on tDCS for treating MD from 1998 through July 2012 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and SCOPUS. We also consulted the Web of Science's Citations Index Expanded for the selected RCTs up to July 2012. The main outcome measures were response and remission rates. We used a random-effects model and Odds Ratios (OR).
RESULTS: Data were obtained from 6 RCTs that included a total of 200 subjects with MD. After an average of 10.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 3.76 tDCS sessions, no significant difference was found between active and sham tDCS in terms of both response (23.3\% [24/103] vs. 12.4\% [12/97], respectively; OR = 1.97; 95\% CI = 0.85-4.57; p = 0.11) and remission (12.2\% [12/98] vs. 5.4\% [5/92], respectively; OR = 2.13; 95\% CI = 0.64-7.06; p = 0.22). Also, no differences between mean baseline depression scores and dropout rates in the active and sham tDCS groups were found. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs that involved less than 10 treatment sessions or stimulus intensity of less than 2 mA did not alter the findings. However, tDCS used as monotherapy was associated with higher response rates when compared to sham tDCS (p = 0.043). Finally, the risk of publication bias in this meta-analysis was found to be low.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical utility of tDCS as a treatment for MD remains unclear when clinically relevant outcomes such as response and remission rates are considered. Future studies should include larger and more representative samples, investigate how tDCS compares to other therapeutic neuromodulation techniques, as well as identify optimal stimulation parameters.},

  abstract = {Neurosteroids are endogenous steroids acting in the central nervous system. They participate in synaptic plasticity, memory and learning, Alzheimer's disease, and certain drug reward. Some mechanisms behind these effects are thought to be nongenomic, e.g., they modulate the function of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex. In this study, we used a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably transfected with NMDA receptor constituents NR1/NR2B, to investigate the effects of nanomolar concentrations of the neurosteroids pregnenolone sulfate (PS) and pregnanolone sulfate (3alpha5betaS) on binding of the radioligand [(3)H]ifenprodil. Neither of the steroids displaced [(3)H]ifenprodil, but both induced a shift in its fit from one to two binding sites. The effects of the neurosteroids were also measured as changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) after glutamate stimulation. Although the steroids did not alter the response to glutamate, they influenced the extent of ifenprodil blockade of the receptor: PS increased and 3alpha5betaS decreased this effect. The coincubation of several NMDA receptor ligands in the assay indicated that PS and 3alpha5betaS act via different binding sites from those for glutamate, glycine, and dithiothreitol. Combining the two steroids revealed that they do not share a common binding site. In conclusion, these results substantiate previous evidence of the allosteric modulatory effect induced by PS and 3alpha5betaS on NMDA receptors at nanomolar concentrations. The neurosteroid-mediated modulation of the receptor is also reflected in an altered glutamate stimulated [Ca(2+)](i), in response to ifenprodil.},

Using a heated-air FS paradigm, we subjected male rat pups to one, three, or nine episodes of brief FS on days 10 to 12 postpartum. Neither hippocampal neuronal damage nor apoptosis was noted within 72 hours after FS, nor was there significant hippocampal neuronal loss, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, or altered seizure threshold to pentylenetetrazol in any FS group at adulthood. The adult rats subjected to nine episodes of early-life FS, however, showed long-term memory deficits as assessed by the Morris water maze. They also exhibited impaired intermediate and long-term memory but spared short-term memory in the inhibitory avoidance task. Three hours after inhibitory avoidance training, phosphorylation of cAMP response-element binding (CREB) protein in the hippocampus was significantly lower in nine-FS-group rats than in controls. Furthermore, rolipram administration, which activated the cAMP-CREB signaling pathway by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type IV, reversed the long-term memory deficits in nine-FS-group rats by enhancing hippocampal CREB phosphorylation. These results raise concerns about the long-term cognitive consequences of even brief frequently repetitive FS during early brain development.},

In this review, we will describe what is known about the role of STDP in shaping feed-forward and recurrent circuits in the optic tectum with a focus on the functional implications for vision. We will discuss both the similarities and differences between the optic tectum and mammalian sensory systems that are relevant to STDP. Finally, we will highlight the unique properties of the embryonic tectum that make it an important system for researchers who are interested in how STDP contributes to activity-dependent development of sensory computations.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00213-013-3002-3},
  abstract = {RATIONALE: Past research has demonstrated that when an animal changes from a previously drug-naive to an opiate-dependent and withdrawn state, morphine's motivational effects are switched from a tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP)-dependent to a dopamine-dependent pathway. Interestingly, a corresponding change is observed in ventral tegmental area (VTA) GABAA receptors, which change from mediating hyperpolarization of VTA GABA neurons to mediating depolarization.
OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated whether pharmacological manipulation of VTA GABAA receptor activity could directly influence the mechanisms underlying opiate motivation.
RESULTS: Using an unbiased place conditioning procedure, we demonstrated that in Wistar rats, intra-VTA administration of furosemide, a Cl(-) cotransporter inhibitor, was able to promote a switch in the mechanisms underlying morphine's motivational properties, one which is normally observed only after chronic opiate exposure. This behavioral switch was prevented by intra-VTA administration of acetazolamide, an inhibitor of the bicarbonate ion-producing carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Electrophysiological recordings of mouse VTA showed that furosemide reduced the sensitivity of VTA GABA neurons to inhibition by the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol, instead increasing the firing rate of a significant subset of these GABA neurons.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the carbonic anhydrase enzyme may constitute part of a common VTA GABA neuron-based biological pathway responsible for controlling the mechanisms underlying opiate motivation, supporting the hypothesis that VTA GABAA receptor hyperpolarization or depolarization is responsible for selecting TPP- or dopamine-dependent motivational outputs, respectively.},

  abstract = {Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) is a well-recognized "marker" that is detected exclusively in post-mitotic neurons and was initially identified through an immunological screen to produce neuron-specific antibodies. Immunostaining evidence indicates that NeuN is distributed in the nuclei of mature neurons in nearly all parts of the vertebrate nervous system. NeuN is highly conserved among species and is stably expressed during specific stages of development. Therefore, NeuN has been considered to be a reliable marker of mature neurons for the past two decades. However, this role has been challenged by recent studies indicating that NeuN staining is variable and even absent during certain diseases and specific physiological states. More importantly, despite the widespread use of the anti-NeuN antibody, the natural identity of the NeuN protein remained elusive for 17~years. NeuN was recently eventually identified as an epitope of Rbfox3, which is a novel member of the Rbfox1 family of splicing factors. This identification might provide a novel perspective on NeuN expression during both physiological and pathological conditions. This review summarizes the current progress on the biochemical identity and biological significance of NeuN and recommends caution when applying NeuN immunoreactivity as a definitive marker of mature neurons in certain diseases and specific physiological states.},

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), one of the most widely used mindfulness training programs, has been reported to produce positive effects on psychological well-being and to ameliorate symptoms of a number of disorders. Here, we report a controlled longitudinal study to investigate pre-post changes in brain gray matter concentration attributable to participation in an MBSR program. Anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images from 16 healthy, meditation-na{\"\i}ve participants were obtained before and after they underwent the 8-week program. Changes in gray matter concentration were investigated using voxel-based morphometry, and compared with a waiting list control group of 17 individuals. Analyses in a priori regions of interest confirmed increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus. Whole brain analyses identified increases in the posterior cingulate cortex, the temporo-parietal junction, and the cerebellum in the MBSR group compared with the controls. The results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.},

  abstract = {Individuals can improve their levels of psychological well-being (PWB) through utilization of psychological interventions, including the practice of mindfulness meditation, which is defined as the non-judgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment. We recently reported that an 8-week-mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course lead to increases in gray matter concentration in several brain areas, as detected with voxel-based morphometry of magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo MRI scans, including the pons/raphe/locus coeruleus area of the brainstem. Given the role of the pons and raphe in mood and arousal, we hypothesized that changes in this region might underlie changes in well-being. A subset of 14 healthy individuals from a previously published data set completed anatomical MRI and filled out the PWB scale before and after MBSR participation. PWB change was used as the predictive regressor for changes in gray matter density within those brain regions that had previously shown pre- to post-MBSR changes. Results showed that scores on five PWB subscales as well as the PWB total score increased significantly over the MBSR course. The change was positively correlated with gray matter concentration increases in two symmetrically bilateral clusters in the brainstem. Those clusters appeared to contain the area of the pontine tegmentum, locus coeruleus, nucleus raphe pontis, and the sensory trigeminal nucleus. No clusters were negatively correlated with the change in PWB. This preliminary study suggests a neural correlate of enhanced PWB. The identified brain areas include the sites of synthesis and release of the neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and serotonin, which are involved in the modulation of arousal and mood, and have been related to a variety of affective functions as well as associated clinical dysfunctions.},

Recent interest in the amygdala arises from its role in processing fear and the relationship of fear to human anxiety. The amygdaloid complex is divided into a number of subnuclei that have extensive intra and extra nuclear connections. In this review we discuss recent findings on the physiology and plasticity of inputs to interneurons in the basolateral amygdala, the primary input station. These interneurons are a heterogeneous group of cells that can be separated on immunohistochemical and electrophysiological grounds. Glutamatergic inputs to these interneurons form diverse types of excitatory synapses. This diversity is manifest in both the subunit composition of the underlying NMDA receptors as well as their ability to show plasticity. We discuss these differences and their relationship to fear learning.

Using rapid time-lapse two-photon calcium imaging of network activity and single-neuron growth within the unanesthetized developing brain, we demonstrate that visual stimulation induces coordinated changes to neuronal responses and dendritogenesis. Further, we identify the transcription factor MEF2A/2D as a major regulator of neuronal response to plasticity-inducing stimuli directing both structural and functional changes. Unpatterned sensory stimuli that change plasticity thresholds induce rapid degradation of MEF2A/2D through a classical apoptotic pathway requiring NMDA receptors and caspases-9 and -3/7. Knockdown of MEF2A/2D alone is sufficient to induce a metaplastic shift in threshold of both functional and morphological plasticity. These findings demonstrate how sensory experience acting through altered levels of the transcription factor MEF2 fine-tunes the plasticity thresholds of brain neurons during neural circuit formation.},

Although the regulation of cortisol secretion is well studied in this condition, there is no information about the diurnal activity of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) secretion. Therefore, we studied 24-h DHEA plasma concentrations (every 30 min) in severely depressed patients (n = 26) and healthy controls (n = 33). We found depression to significantly increase diurnal minimal and mean DHEA plasma concentrations, whereas there was no effect on the diurnal maximal plasma concentration and the diurnal amplitude of DHEA. In particular, we found a parallel increase in mean DHEA (5.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.9 nmol/L; P \ensuremath{<} 0.003), cortisol (286 +/- 65 vs. 184 +/- 29 nmol/L; P \ensuremath{<} 0.0001) and ACTH (7.14 +/- 2.06 vs. 5.72 +/- 1.36 pmol/L; P \ensuremath{<} 0.002) plasma concentrations.

Olson Prize for the publication of the outstanding behavioral article published in the journal Peptides in 2002, examines the 30-year historical perspective of the role of the endogenous opioid system in feeding behavior. The review focuses on the advances that this field has made over the past 30 years as a result of the timely discoveries that were made concerning this important neuropeptide system, and how these discoveries were quickly applied to the analysis of feeding behavior and attendant homeostatic processes. The discoveries of the opioid receptors and opioid peptides, and the establishment of their relevance to feeding behavior were pivotal in studies performed in the 1970s. The 1980s were characterized by the establishment of opioid receptor subtype agonists and antagonists and their relevance to the modulation of feeding behavior as well as by the use of general opioid antagonists in demonstrating the wide array of ingestive situations and paradigms involving the endogenous opioid system. The more recent work from the 1990s to the present, utilizes the advantages created by the cloning of the opioid receptor genes, the development of knockout and knockdown techniques, the systematic utilization of a systems neuroscience approach, and establishment of the reciprocity of how manipulations of opioid peptides and receptors affect feeding behavior with how feeding states affect levels of opioid peptides and receptors. The role of G-protein effector systems in opioid-mediated feeding responses, which was the subject of the prize-winning article, is then reviewed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Our experiences can blind us. Once we have learned to solve problems by one method, we often have difficulties in generating solutions involving a different kind of insight. Yet there is evidence that people with brain lesions are sometimes more resistant to this so-called mental set effect. This inspired us to investigate whether the mental set effect can be reduced by non-invasive brain stimulation. 60 healthy right-handed participants were asked to take an insight problem solving task while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the anterior temporal lobes (ATL). Only 20\% of participants solved an insight problem with sham stimulation (control), whereas 3 times as many participants did so (p\ensuremath{\mkern1mu}=\ensuremath{\mkern1mu}0.011) with cathodal stimulation (decreased excitability) of the left ATL together with anodal stimulation (increased excitability) of the right ATL. We found hemispheric differences in that a stimulation montage involving the opposite polarities did not facilitate performance. Our findings are consistent with the theory that inhibition to the left ATL can lead to a cognitive style that is less influenced by mental templates and that the right ATL may be associated with insight or novel meaning. Further studies including neurophysiological imaging are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms leading to the enhancement.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: \ensuremath{\beta}-amyloid (A\ensuremath{\beta}) accumulation is described as a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A\ensuremath{\beta} perturbs a number of synaptic components including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing \ensuremath{\alpha}7 subunits (\ensuremath{\alpha}7-nAChRs), which are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus and found on GABAergic interneurons. We have previously demonstrated the existence of a novel, heteromeric \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChR in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that exhibits high sensitivity to acute A\ensuremath{\beta} exposure. To extend our previous work, we evaluated the expression and pharmacology of \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChRs in hippocampal interneurons and their sensitivity to A\ensuremath{\beta}.
RESULTS: GABAergic interneurons in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus expressed functional \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChRs, which were characterized by relatively slow whole-cell current kinetics, pharmacological sensitivity to dihydro-\ensuremath{\beta}-erythroidine (DH\ensuremath{\beta}E), a nAChR \ensuremath{\beta}2* subunit selective blocker, and \ensuremath{\alpha}7 and \ensuremath{\beta}2 subunit interaction using immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChRs were sensitive to 1 nM oligomeric A\ensuremath{\beta}. Similar effects were observed in identified hippocampal interneurons prepared from GFP-GAD mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that A\ensuremath{\beta} modulation of cholinergic signaling in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons via \ensuremath{\alpha}7\ensuremath{\beta}2-nAChRs could be an early and critical event in A\ensuremath{\beta}-induced functional abnormalities of hippocampal function, which may be relevant to learning and memory deficits in AD.},

  doi = {10.3389/fnhum.2012.00292},
  abstract = {The amygdala has been repeatedly implicated in emotional processing of both positive and negative-valence stimuli. Previous studies suggest that the amygdala response to emotional stimuli is lower when the subject is in a meditative state of mindful-attention, both in beginner meditators after an 8-week meditation intervention and in expert meditators. However, the longitudinal effects of meditation training on amygdala responses have not been reported when participants are in an ordinary, non-meditative state. In this study, we investigated how 8 weeks of training in meditation affects amygdala responses to emotional stimuli in subjects when in a non-meditative state. Healthy adults with no prior meditation experience took part in 8 weeks of either Mindful Attention Training (MAT), Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT; a program based on Tibetan Buddhist compassion meditation practices), or an active control intervention. Before and after the intervention, participants underwent an fMRI experiment during which they were presented images with positive, negative, and neutral emotional valences from the IAPS database while remaining in an ordinary, non-meditative state. Using a region-of-interest analysis, we found a longitudinal decrease in right amygdala activation in the Mindful Attention group in response to positive images, and in response to images of all valences overall. In the CBCT group, we found a trend increase in right amygdala response to negative images, which was significantly correlated with a decrease in depression score. No effects or trends were observed in the control group. This finding suggests that the effects of meditation training on emotional processing might transfer to non-meditative states. This is consistent with the hypothesis that meditation training may induce learning that is not stimulus- or task-specific, but process-specific, and thereby may result in enduring changes in mental function.},

This stimulation on a behaviorally relevant time scale evoked coordinated, complex postures that involved many joints. For example, stimulation of one site caused the mouth to open and also caused the hand to shape into a grip posture and move to the mouth. Stimulation of this site always drove the joints toward this final posture, regardless of the direction of movement required to reach the posture. Stimulation of other cortical sites evoked different postures. Postures that involved the arm were arranged across cortex to form a map of hand positions around the body. This stimulation-evoked map encompassed both primary motor and the adjacent premotor cortex. We suggest that these regions fit together into a single map of the workspace around the body.},

  abstract = {Neuroprotection following status epilepticus should encompass not only the prevention of neuronal death, but also preservation of neuronal and network function. This is critical because these aims are not necessarily equivalent; prevention of neuronal loss, for example, does not inevitably prevent epileptogenesis. There are endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms that can serve dichotomous roles (e.g. ERK1/2 activation can result in either neuroprotection or promote neuronal death). The roles of potential endogenous mechanisms can depend upon the pattern and timing of their activation. The simplest exogenous neuroprotective mechanism is to halt seizure activity. Other approaches consist of early NMDA receptor antagonism or later inhibition of apoptotic pathways. The problem with the latter approach is that calcium accumulation results in the activation of a number of downstream pathways, the importance of which varies from region to region and in a cell-type specific manner. Neuroprotection in epilepsy is not a straightforward concept, and we need to be clear about our eventual objectives (e.g. preventing cognitive decline). There are numerous possible approaches to neuroprotection, and the efficacy of these depends upon their timing, the specific aims and even the method of status epilepticus induction.},

  abstract = {Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a small peptide important in cardiovascular physiology, feeding, anxiety, depression and epilepsy. In the hippocampus, NPY is mainly produced and released by GABAergic interneurons and inhibits glutamatergic neurotransmission in the excitatory tri-synaptic circuit. Under epileptic conditions, there is a robust overexpression of NPY and NPY receptors particularly in the granular and pyramidal cells, contributing to the tonic inhibition of glutamate release and consequently to control the spread of excitability into other brain structures. Recently, an important role was attributed to NPY in neuroprotection against excitotoxicity and in the modulation of neurogenesis. In the present review we discuss the potential relevance of NPY and NPY receptors in neuroprotection and neurogenesis, with implications for brain repair strategies. Recent patents describing new NPY receptor antagonists directed to treat obesity and cardiovascular disorders were published. However, the NPYergic system may also prove to be a good target for the treatment of pharmaco-resistant forms of temporal lobe epilepsy, by acting on hyperexcitability, neuronal death or brain repair. In order to achieve new NPY-based antiepileptic and brain repair strategies, selective NPY receptor agonists able to reach their targets in the epileptic brain must be developed in the near future.},

These are areas of active research. Here we review current knowledge of the contribution of the NMDA receptor, one of the several types of glutamate receptor, to depression and its treatment. Several lines of evidence, in humans and in animal models, support the contention that neurotransmission via the NMDA receptor is dysregulated in depression. Drugs that target the NMDA receptor have shown antidepressant properties in both clinical and preclinical studies. Nevertheless, other effects of such medications, including both cognitive side effects and their psychotomimetic properties, complicate such an application and represent a challenge to the development of clinically useful agents.},

  abstract = {Peroxynitrite is usually considered as a neurotoxic nitric oxide-derivative. However, an increasing body of evidence suggests that, at low concentrations, peroxynitrite affords transient cytoprotection, both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we addressed the signaling mechanism responsible for this effect, and found that rat cortical neurons in primary culture acutely exposed to peroxynitrite (0.1 mmol/L) rapidly elicited Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation. Inhibition of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway with wortmannin or Akt small hairpin RNA (shRNA) abolished the ability of peroxynitrite to prevent etoposide-induced apoptotic death. Endogenous peroxynitrite formation by short-term incubation of neurons with glutamate stimulated Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation, whereas Akt shRNA enhanced the vulnerability of neurons against glutamate. We further show that Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation was consequence of the oxidizing, but not the nitrating properties of peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite failed to nitrate or phosphorylate neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks), and it did not modify the ability of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), to phosphorylate its cognate receptor, TrkB; however, peroxynitrite enhanced BDNF-mediated Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation. Finally, we found that peroxynitrite-stimulated Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation was associated with an increased proportion of oxidized phosphoinositide phosphatase, PTEN, in neurons. Moreover, peroxynitrite prevented the increase of apoptotic neuronal death caused by over-expression of PTEN. Thus, peroxynitrite exerts neuroprotection by inhibiting PTEN, hence activating the anti-apoptotic PI3K/Akt pathway in primary neurons.},

  abstract = {The cholinergic systems play a pivotal role in learning and memory, and have been the centre of attention when it comes to diseases containing cognitive deficits. It is therefore not surprising, that the cholinergic transmitter system has experienced detailed examination of its role in numerous behavioural situations not least with the perspective that cognition may be rescued with appropriate cholinergic `boosters'.

Here we reviewed the literature on (i) cholinergic lesions, (ii) pharmacological intervention of muscarinic or nicotinic system, or (iii) genetic deletion of selective receptor subtypes with respect to sensory discrimination and conditioning procedures. We consider visual, auditory, olfactory and somatosensory processing first before discussing more complex tasks such as startle responses, latent inhibition, negative patterning, eye blink and fear conditioning, and passive avoidance paradigms.

An overarching reoccurring theme is that lesions of the cholinergic projection neurones of the basal forebrain impact negatively on acquisition learning in these paradigms and blockade of muscarinic (and to a lesser extent nicotinic) receptors in the target structures produce similar behavioural deficits. While these pertain mainly to impairments in acquisition learning, some rare cases extend to memory consolidation. Such single case observations warranted replication and more in-depth studies. Intriguingly, receptor blockade or receptor gene knockout repeatedly produced contradictory results (for example in fear conditioning) and combined studies, in which genetically altered mice are pharmacological manipulated, are so far missing. However, they are desperately needed to clarify underlying reasons for these contradictions.

Consistently, stimulation of either muscarinic (mainly M1) or nicotinic (predominantly \ensuremath{\alpha}7) receptors was beneficial for learning and memory formation across all paradigms supporting the notion that research into the development and mechanisms of novel and better cholinomimetics may prove useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders with cognitive endophenotypes.},

Recent in vivo imaging studies demonstrate that long-term plasticity of inhibitory circuits is manifested at an anatomical level. Changes in sensory experience drive structural remodeling in inhibitory interneurons in a cell-type and circuit-specific manner. Inhibitory synapse formation and elimination can occur with a great deal of spatial and temporal precision and are locally coordinated with excitatory synaptic changes on the same neuron. We suggest that the specificity of inhibitory synapse dynamics may serve to differentially modulate activity across the dendritic arbor, to selectively tune parts of a local circuit, or potentially discriminate between activities in distinct local circuits. We further review evidence suggesting that inhibitory circuit structural changes instruct excitatory/inhibitory balance while enabling functional reorganization to occur through Hebbian forms of plasticity.},

The MTL receives massive inputs from visual cortical areas, and evidence over the last decade has consistently shown that MTL neurons respond selectively to complex visual stimuli. Here, we focus on how the activity patterns of these cells might reflect the transformation of visual percepts into long-term memories. Given the very sparse and abstract representation of visual information by these neurons, they could in principle be considered as 'grandmother cells'. However, we give several arguments that make such an extreme interpretation unlikely.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been found to improve working memory (WM) performance in both healthy and clinical participants. However, whether this effect can be enhanced by cognitive activity undertaken during tDCS has not yet been explored.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore whether tDCS applied to the left DLPFC during the persistent performance of one WM task would improve performance on a subsequent WM task, to a greater extent than either tDCS or cognitive activity alone.
METHODS: Ten healthy participants took part in three counterbalanced conditions. The conditions involved 10 minutes of either anodal tDCS while completing an n-back task, anodal tDCS while at rest, or sham tDCS while completing an n-back task. The n-back that was used in this study was a computer-based letter WM task that involved 5 minutes of two-back, followed by 5 minutes of three-back. Digit span forward and backward was administered immediately before and after each treatment, and performance change (pre- to posttreatment) calculated and compared across conditions. The digit span tasks involved a series of numbers being read to the participant, and the participant was required to repeat them back, either in the same order (Digits forward) or in the reverse order (Digits backward).
RESULTS: tDCS applied during completion of the n-back task was found to result in greater improvement in performance on digit span forward, compared with tDCS applied while at rest and sham tDCS during the n-back task. This finding was not evident with digit span backward.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that there may be potential for the use of adjunctive cognitive remediation techniques to enhance the effects of tDCS. However, further research needs to be undertaken in this area to replicate and extend this finding.},

  abstract = {Objective: ADHD is a childhood-onset psychiatric condition that often continues into adulthood. Stimulant medications are the mainstay of treatment; however, additional approaches are frequently desired. In recent years, mindfulness meditation has been proposed to improve attention, reduce stress, and improve mood. This study tests the feasibility of an 8-week mindfulness training program for adults and adolescents with ADHD. Method: Twenty-four adults and eight adolescents with ADHD enrolled in a feasibility study of an 8-week mindfulness training program. Results: The majority of participants completed the training and reported high satisfaction with the training. Pre\textemdash{}post improvements in self-reported ADHD symptoms and test performance on tasks measuring attention and cognitive inhibition were noted. Improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms were also observed. Conclusion: Mindfulness training is a feasible intervention in a subset of ADHD adults and adolescents and may improve behavioral and neurocognitive impairments. A controlled clinical study is warranted. (J. of Att. Dis. 2008; 11(6) 737-746)},

Yet others suggests mPFC supports memory and consolidation on time-scales ranging from seconds to days. How can all these roles be reconciled? We propose that the function of the mPFC is to learn associations between context, locations, events, and corresponding adaptive responses, particularly emotional responses. Thus, the ubiquitous involvement of mPFC in both memory and decision making may be due to the fact that almost all such tasks entail the ability to recall the best action or emotional response to specific events in a particular place and time. An interaction between multiple memory systems may explain the changing importance of mPFC to different types of memories over time. In particular, mPFC likely relies on the hippocampus to support rapid learning and memory consolidation.},

Rats were given ALCAR (100 mg/kg) per os for 3 months and were subjected to the Hebb-Williams tasks and a new maze task, AKON-1, to assess their learning capacity. The learning capacity of the ALCAR-treated group was superior to that of the control. Cholinergic activities were determined with synaptosomes isolated from the cortices. The high-affinity choline uptake by synaptosomes, acetylcholine synthesis in synaptosomes, and acetylcholine release from synaptosomes on membrane depolarization were all enhanced in the ALCAR group. This study indicates that chronic administration of ALCAR increases cholinergic synaptic transmission and consequently enhances learning capacity as a cognitive function in aging rats.},

In particular, interneuronal neuropeptides appear to play roles in cognition and as endogenous anti-epileptic agents.

  abstract = {Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism that optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.},

However, effects on synaptic plasticity reported are often weak, highly variable between individuals, and rarely last longer than 30 min.

Although such events have been observed in many neuronal types, it is not well understood how active dendrites contribute to the tuning of neuronal output in vivo. Here we show that dendritic spikes increase the selectivity of neuronal responses to the orientation of a visual stimulus (orientation tuning). We performed direct patch-clamp recordings from the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of lightly anaesthetized and awake mice, during sensory processing. Visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic spikes that were distinct from back-propagating action potentials. These events were orientation tuned and were suppressed by either hyperpolarization of membrane potential or intracellular blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. Both of these manipulations also decreased the selectivity of subthreshold orientation tuning measured at the soma, thus linking dendritic regenerative events to somatic orientation tuning. Together, our results suggest that dendritic spikes that are triggered by visual input contribute to a fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, dendritic excitability is an essential component of behaviourally relevant computations in neurons.},

  abstract = {For the past two decades an increasing number of studies have underlined the crucial role of the immediate \textendash{} early gene Arc in plasticity processes thought to sustain memory function. Because of the high spatial and temporal resolution of this technique, the detection of Arc products appears to have become a new standard for the mapping of cognitive processes. To date, most Arc studies have focused on identifying the contribution of the hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3 to spatial processes. In contrast, few have investigated their role in non-spatial memory, or the role of other medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas in spatial and non-spatial memory. This short review describes recent studies focusing on these issues. After a brief overview of Arc's functions, we report a set of studies that put to the test some well-accepted theories in recognition memory. First, we describe data indicating that the parahippocampal areas may not be strictly segregated into spatial and non-spatial streams, as originally described. Second, we report findings revealing a functional segregation along the dorsoventral axis in CA1, but not in CA3. Finally, we bring evidence for a segregation of CA3 along the proximodistal axis and discuss the involvement of a proximal CA3-distal CA1 network during non-spatial memory. In summary, `Arc imaging' appears to be a powerful tool to identify neural substrates of cognitive processes, not only in the hippocampus but also in the remaining of the MTL. Moreover, because of its fundamental role in synaptic processes, it offers a rare and exciting opportunity to further bridge plasticity processes and memory function.},

Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and a task-switching version of the Stroop task were used to examine whether these components of cognitive control have distinct neural bases in the human brain. A double dissociation was found. During task preparation, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9) was more active for color naming than for word reading, consistent with a role in the implementation of control. In contrast, the anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann's areas 24 and 32) was more active when responding to incongruent stimuli, consistent with a role in performance monitoring.},

The review focuses on the mental processes and the underlying neural circuitry that are critically involved in two styles of meditation. One style, Focused Attention (FA) meditation, entails the voluntary focusing of attention on a chosen object. The other style, Open Monitoring (OM) meditation, involves non-reactive monitoring of the content of experience from moment to moment. We discuss the potential regulatory functions of these practices on attention and emotion processes and their putative long-term impact on the brain and behavior.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soluble oligomers of amyloid \ss{}-protein (A\ss{}) have been increasingly linked to synaptic dysfunction, tau alteration, and neuritic dystrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mouse models. There is a great need for assays that quantify A\ss{} oligomers with high specificity and sensitivity.
METHODS: We designed and validated two oligomer-specific (o-) enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) using either an A\ss{} aggregate-selective monoclonal for capture and a monoclonal to the free N-terminus for detection, or the latter antibody for both capture and detection.
RESULTS: The o-ELISAs specifically quantified pure oligomers of synthetic A\ss{} with sizes from dimers up to much larger assemblies and over a wide dynamic range of concentrations, whereas A\ss{} monomers were undetectable. Natural A\ss{} oligomers of similarly wide size and concentration ranges were measured in extracts of AD and control brains, revealing \ensuremath{>}1000-fold higher concentrations of A\ss{} oligomers than monomers in the soluble fraction of AD cortex. The assays quantified the age-related rise in oligomers in hAPP transgenic mice. Unexpectedly, none of 90 human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples gave a specific signal in either o-ELISA.
CONCLUSIONS: These new o-ELISAs with rigorously confirmed specificity can quantify oligomer burden in human and mouse brains for diagnostic and mechanistic studies and for AD biomarker development. However, our data raise the likelihood that the hydrophobicity of A\ss{} oligomers makes them very low in number or absent in aqueous CSF.},

  abstract = {The formation of fibrillar aggregates has long been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Although fibrils are still considered important to the pathology of these disorders, it is now widely understood that smaller amyloid oligomers are the toxic entities along the misfolding pathway. One characteristic shared by the majority of amyloid oligomers is the ability to disrupt membranes, a commonality proposed to be responsible for their toxicity, although the mechanisms linking this to cell death are poorly understood. Here, we describe the physical basis for the cytotoxicity of oligomers formed by the prion protein (PrP)-derived amyloid peptide PrP(106\textendash{}126). We show that oligomers of this peptide kill several mammalian cells lines, as well as mouse cerebellar organotypic cultures, and we also show that they exhibit antimicrobial activity. Physical perturbation of model membranes mimicking bacterial or mammalian cells was investigated using atomic force microscopy, polarized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and NMR spectroscopy. Disruption of anionic membranes proceeds through a carpet or detergent model as proposed for other antimicrobial peptides. By contrast, when added to zwitterionic membranes containing cholesterol-rich ordered domains, PrP(106\textendash{}126) oligomers induce a loss of domain separation and decreased membrane disorder. Loss of raft-like domains may lead to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cell death. This work sheds new light on the physical mechanisms of amyloid cytotoxicity and is the first to clearly show membrane type-specific modes of action for a cytotoxic peptide.},

  abstract = {Neuromodulatory input, acting on G protein-coupled receptors, is essential for the induction of experience-dependent cortical plasticity. Here we report that G-coupled receptors in layer II/III of visual cortex control the polarity of synaptic plasticity through a pull-push regulation of LTP and LTD. In slices, receptors coupled to Gs promote LTP while suppressing LTD; conversely, receptors coupled to Gq11 promote LTD and suppress LTP. In vivo, the selective stimulation of Gs- or Gq11-coupled receptors brings the cortex into LTP-only or LTD-only states, which allows the potentiation or depression of targeted synapses with visual stimulation. The pull-push regulation of LTP/LTD occurs via direct control of the synaptic plasticity machinery and it is independent of changes in NMDAR activation or neuronal excitability. We propose these simple rules governing the pull-push control of LTP/LTD form a general metaplasticity mechanism that may contribute to neuromodulation of plasticity in other cortical circuits.},

  abstract = {Synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss are key features of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Previously, we showed an essential function of APP and APLP2 for synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Here, we used organotypic hippocampal cultures to investigate the specific role(s) of APP family members and their fragments for dendritic complexity and spine formation of principal neurons within the hippocampus. Whereas CA1 neurons from APLP1-KO or APLP2-KO mice showed normal neuronal morphology and spine density, APP-KO mice revealed a highly reduced dendritic complexity in mid-apical dendrites. Despite unaltered morphology of APLP2-KO neurons, combined APP/APLP2-DKO mutants showed an additional branching defect in proximal apical dendrites, indicating redundancy and a combined function of APP and APLP2 for dendritic architecture. Remarkably, APP-KO neurons showed a pronounced decrease in spine density and reductions in the number of mushroom spines. No further decrease in spine density, however, was detectable in APP/APLP2-DKO mice. Mechanistically, using APPs\ensuremath{\alpha}-KI mice lacking transmembrane APP and expressing solely the secreted APPs\ensuremath{\alpha} fragment we demonstrate that APPs\ensuremath{\alpha} expression alone is sufficient to prevent the defects in spine density observed in APP-KO mice. Collectively, these studies reveal a combined role of APP and APLP2 for dendritic architecture and a unique function of secreted APPs for spine density.},

Brain imaging studies have implicated the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) in this ability, but causal evidence for its role is lacking. A debate is also ongoing regarding whether the control of, or switching between, self and other representations is a specialized or domain-general process: the rTPJ's well-established role in reorienting attention supports a domain-general process, but a role specific to social cognition has also been proposed. Neuronavigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to target the rTPJ (and a control mid-occipital site) during a task requiring participants to switch between representations of others' actions on both a social and a nonsocial level, by manipulating imitative and spatial compatibility simultaneously and independently. Both imitative and spatial compatibility effects were apparent on response times; however, the effect of imitative compatibility was significantly stronger, indicating less control of imitation, during stimulation of the rTPJ relative to the control site. This suggests that the rTPJ is involved in switching between self and other representations, and further, that this process may not be entirely domain general.},

  abstract = {The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has a crucial role in emotional learning irrespective of valence. The BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviours, but our understanding of the interaction between these two brain regions has been limited by the inability to manipulate neural-circuit elements of this pathway selectively during behaviour. To circumvent this limitation, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of glutamatergic fibres from the BLA to the NAc, coupled with intracranial pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiology. Here we show that optical stimulation of the pathway from the BLA to the NAc in mice reinforces behavioural responding to earn additional optical stimulation of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of these glutamatergic fibres required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signalling, but not D2-type receptor signalling. Brief optical inhibition of fibres from the BLA to the NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose, demonstrating an important role of this specific pathway in controlling naturally occurring reward-related behaviour. Moreover, although optical stimulation of glutamatergic fibres from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc also elicited reliable excitatory synaptic responses, optical self-stimulation behaviour was not observed by activation of this pathway. These data indicate that whereas the BLA is important for processing both positive and negative affect, the glutamatergic pathway from the BLA to the NAc, in conjunction with dopamine signalling in the NAc, promotes motivated behavioural responding. Thus, optogenetic manipulation of anatomically distinct synaptic inputs to the NAc reveals functionally distinct properties of these inputs in controlling reward-seeking behaviours.},

Overall, for children with febrile seizures compared with those without such seizures, the rate ratio for epilepsy was 5.43 (95\% confidence interval: 5.19, 5.69). The risk remained high during the entire follow-up but was particularly high shortly after the first febrile seizure, especially in children who experienced early (\ensuremath{<}1 year of age) or late (\ensuremath{>}3 years of age) onset of febrile seizures. At 23 years of follow-up, the overall cumulative incidence of epilepsy after febrile seizures was 6.9\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.5, 7.3). In conclusion, persons with a history of febrile seizures had a higher rate of epilepsy that lasted into adult life, but less than 7 percent of children with febrile seizures developed epilepsy during 23 years of follow-up. The risk was higher for those who had a family history of epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or low Apgar scores at 5 minutes.},

  abstract = {Active behavior, such as exploring a novel environment, induces the expression of the immediate-early gene Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein, or Arg 3.1) in many brain regions, including the hippocampus, neocortex, and striatum. Arc messenger ribonucleic acid and protein are localized in activated dendrites, and Arc protein is required for the maintenance of long-term potentiation and memory consolidation. Although previous evidence suggests that Arc is expressed in neurons, there is no direct demonstration that only neurons can express Arc. Furthermore, there is no characterization of the main neuronal types that express Arc. The data reported here show that behavior- or seizure-induced Arc expression in the hippocampus, primary somatosensory cortex, and dorsal striatum of rats colocalizes only with neuronal (NeuN-positive) and not with glial (GFAP-positive) cells. Furthermore, Arc was found exclusively in non-GABAergic alpha-CaMKII-positive hippocampal and neocortical neurons of rats that had explored a novel environment. Some GAD65/67-positive neurons in these regions were observed to express Arc, but only after a very strong stimulus (electroconvulsive seizure). In the dorsal striatum, spatial exploration induced Arc only in GABAergic and alpha-CaMKII-positive neurons. Combined, these results show that although a very strong stimulus (seizure) can induce Arc in a variety of neurons, behavior induces Arc in the CaMKII-positive principal neurons of the hippocampus, neocortex, and dorsal striatum. These results, coupled with recent in vitro findings of interactions between Arc and CaMKII, are consistent with the hypothesis that Arc and CaMKII act as plasticity partners to promote functional and/or structural synaptic modifications that accompany learning.},

  abstract = {The neural basis of auditory fear conditioning (AFC) is almost universally believed to be the amygdala, where auditory fear memories are reputedly acquired and stored. This widely-accepted amygdala model holds that the auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) and the nociceptive unconditioned stimulus (US) first converge in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (AL), and are projected independently to it from the medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGm) and the adjacent posterior intralaminar nucleus (PIN), which serve merely as sensory relays. However, the four criteria that are used to support the AL model, (a) CS-US convergence, (b) associative plasticity, (c) LTP and (d) lesion-induced learning impairment, are also met by the MGm/PIN. Synaptic and molecular approaches supporting the AL also implicate the MGm/PIN. As both the AL and its preceding MGm/PIN are critically involved, we propose that the latter be considered the "root" of AFC.},

Whereas synaptic plasticity, an important cellular mechanism, has been studied in great detail, we know much less about how learning is implemented at the level of neuronal circuits and, in particular, how interactions between distinct types of neurons within local networks contribute to the process of learning. Here we show that acquisition of associative fear memories depends on the recruitment of a disinhibitory microcircuit in the mouse auditory cortex. Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning. Together, these data demonstrate that stimulus convergence in the auditory cortex is necessary for associative fear learning to complex tones, define the circuit elements mediating this convergence and suggest that layer-1-mediated disinhibition is an important mechanism underlying learning and information processing in neocortical circuits.},

Here we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) guided using neuroimaging to increase learning rate in a novel, minimally guided discovery-learning paradigm. Ninety-six subjects identified threat-related objects concealed in naturalistic virtual surroundings used in real-world training. A variety of brain networks were found using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected at different stages of learning, with two of these networks focused in right inferior frontal and right parietal cortex. Anodal 2.0 mA tDCS performed for 30 min over these regions in a series of single-blind, randomized studies resulted in significant improvements in learning and performance compared with 0.1 mA tDCS. This difference in performance increased to a factor of two after a one-hour delay. A dose\textendash{}response effect of current strength on learning was also found. Taken together, these brain imaging and stimulation studies suggest that right frontal and parietal cortex are involved in learning to identify concealed objects in naturalistic surroundings. Furthermore, they suggest that the application of anodal tDCS over these regions can greatly increase learning, resulting in one of the largest effects on learning yet reported. The methods developed here may be useful to decrease the time required to attain expertise in a variety of settings.},

  abstract = {Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) proteins are important regulators of gene expression during the development of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. MEF2 proteins are also present in brain and recently have been implicated in neuronal survival and differentiation. In this study we examined the cellular mechanisms regulating the activity of MEF2s during apoptosis of cultured cerebellar granule neurons, an established in vitromodel for studying depolarization-dependent neuronal survival. All four MEF2 isoforms (A, B, C, and D) were detected by immunoblot analysis in cerebellar granule neurons. Endogenous MEF2A and MEF2D, but not MEF2B or MEF2C, were phosphorylated with the induction of apoptosis. The putative sites that were phosphorylated during apoptosis are functionally distinct from those previously reported to enhance MEF2 transcription. The increased phosphorylation of MEF2A and MEF2D was followed by decreased DNA binding, reduced transcriptional activity, and caspase-dependent cleavage to fragments containing N-terminal DNA binding domains and C-terminal transactivation domains. Expression of the highly homologous N terminus of MEF2A (1\textendash{}131 amino acids) antagonized the transcriptional activity and prosurvival effects of a constitutively active mutant of MEF2D (MEF2D-VP16). We conclude that MEF2A and MEF2D are prosurvival factors with high transcriptional activity in postmitotic cerebellar granule neurons. When these neurons are induced to undergo apoptosis by lowering extracellular potassium, MEF2A and MEF2D are phosphorylated, followed by decreased DNA binding and cleavage by a caspase-sensitive pathway to N-terminal fragments lacking the transactivation domains. The degradation of MEF2D and MEF2A and the generation of MEF2 fragments that have the potential to act as dominant-inactive transcription factors lead to apoptotic cell death.},

  abstract = {The group of nuclei within the basal ganglia of the forebrain is central to the control of movement. We present data showing that the structure and function of the basal ganglia have been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution over some 560 million years. The interaction between the different nuclei within the basal ganglia is conserved as well as the cellular and synaptic properties and transmitters. We consider the role of the conserved basal ganglia circuitry for basic patterns of motor behaviour controlled via brainstem circuits. The output of the basal ganglia consists of tonically active GABAergic neurones, which target brainstem motor centres responsible for different patterns of behaviour, such as eye and locomotor movements, posture, and feeding. A prerequisite for activating or releasing a motor programme is that this GABAergic inhibition is temporarily reduced. This can be achieved through activation of GABAergic projection neurons from striatum, the input level of the basal ganglia, given an appropriate synaptic drive from cortex, thalamus and the dopamine system. The tonic inhibition of the motor centres at rest most likely serves to prevent the different motor programmes from becoming active when not intended. Striatal projection neurones are subdivided into one group with dopamine 1 receptors that provides increased excitability of the direct pathway that can initiate movements, while inhibitory dopamine 2 receptors are expressed on neurones that instead inhibit movements and are part of the 'indirect loop' in mammals as well as lamprey. We review the evidence showing that all basic features of the basal ganglia have been conserved throughout vertebrate phylogeny, and discuss these findings in relation to the role of the basal ganglia in selection of behaviour.},

The measures of A\ensuremath{\beta} deposition, A\ensuremath{\beta}-immunoreactive plaques with and without cores, thioflavin histofluorescent plaques, and concentrations of insoluble A\ensuremath{\beta}, failed to distinguish HPC from AD patients and were poor correlates of synaptic change. By contrast, concentrations of soluble A\ensuremath{\beta} clearly distinguished HPC from AD patients and were a strong inverse correlate of synapse loss. Further investigation revealed that A\ensuremath{\beta}40, whether in soluble or insoluble form, was a particularly useful measure for classifying ND, HPC, and AD patients compared with A\ensuremath{\beta}42. A\ensuremath{\beta}40 is known to be elevated in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, and A\ensuremath{\beta}40 (but not A\ensuremath{\beta}42) levels, cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, and ApoE4 allele frequency were all highly correlated with each other. Although paired helical filaments in the form of neurofibrillary tangles or a penumbra of neurites surrounding amyloid cores also distinguished HPC from AD patients, they were less robust predictors of synapse change compared with soluble A\ensuremath{\beta}, particularly soluble A\ensuremath{\beta}40. Previous experiments attempting to relate A\ensuremath{\beta} deposition to the neurodegeneration that underlies AD dementia may have failed because they assayed the classical, visible forms of the molecule, insoluble neuropil plaques, rather than the soluble, unseen forms of the molecule.},

Some studies have suggested that transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), a form of NIBS, can also be used to enhance cognitive performance. Critically, research so far has primarily focused on optimizing protocols for effective stimulation, or assessing potential physical side effects of TES, while neglecting the possibility of cognitive side effects. We assessed this possibility by targeting the high-level cognitive abilities of learning and automaticity in the mathematical domain. Notably, learning and automaticity represent critical abilities for potential cognitive enhancement in typical and atypical populations. Over 6 days, healthy human adults underwent cognitive training on a new numerical notation while receiving TES to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Stimulation to the PPC facilitated numerical learning, whereas automaticity for the learned material was impaired. In contrast, stimulation to the DLPFC impaired the learning process whereas automaticity for the learned material was enhanced. The observed double dissociation indicates that cognitive enhancement through TES can occur at the expense of other cognitive functions. These findings have important implications for the future use of enhancement technologies for neurointervention and performance improvement in healthy populations.},

  abstract = {Seizures in adult rats result in long-term deficits in learning and memory, as well as an enhanced susceptibility to further seizures. In contrast, fewer lasting changes have been found following seizures in rats younger than 20 days old. This age-dependency could be due to differing amounts of hippocampal neuronal damage produced by seizures at different ages. To determine if there is an early developmental resistance to seizure-induced hippocampal damage, we compared the effects of kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus and amygdala kindling on hippocampal dentate gyrus anatomy and electrophysiology, in immature (16 day old) and adult rats. In adult rats, KA status epilepticus resulted in numerous silver-stained degenerating dentate hilar neurons, pyramidal cells in fields CA1 and CA3, and marked numerical reductions in CA3c pyramidal neuron counts (-57\%) in separate rats. Two weeks following the last kindled seizure, some, but significantly less, CA3c pyramidal cell loss was observed (-26\%). Both KA status epilepticus and kindling in duced mossy-fiber sprouting, as evidenced by ectopic Timm staining in supragranular layers of the dentate gyrus. In hippocampal slices from adult rats, paired-pulse stimulation of perforant path axons revealed a persistent enhancement of dentate granule-cell inhibition following KA status epilepticus or kindling. While seizures induced by KA or kindling in 16-day-old rats were typically more severe than in adults, the immature hippocampus exhibited markedly less KA-induced cell loss (-22\%), no kindling-induced loss, no detectable synaptic rearrangement, and no change in dentate inhibition. These results demonstrate that, in immature rats, neither severe KA-induced seizures nor repeated kindled seizures produce the kind of hippocampal damage and changes associated with even less severe seizures in adults. The lesser magnitude of seizure-induced hippocampal alterations in immature rats may explain their greater resistance to long-term effects of seizures on neuronal function, as well as future seizure susceptibility. Conversely, hippocampal neuron loss and altered synaptic physiology in adults may contribute to increased sensitivity to epileptogenic stimuli, spontaneous seizures, and behavioral deficits.},

  abstract = {Opiates, like other addictive drugs, elevate forebrain dopamine levels and are thought to do so mainly by inhibiting GABA neurons near the ventral tegmental area (VTA), in turn leading to a disinhibition of dopamine neurons. However, cholinergic inputs from the laterodorsal (LDT) and pedunculopontine (PPT) tegmental nucleus to the VTA and substantia nigra (SN) importantly contribute, as either LDT or PPT lesions strongly attenuate morphine-induced forebrain dopamine elevations. Pharmacological blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the VTA or SN has similar effects. M5 muscarinic receptors are the only muscarinic receptor subtype associated with VTA and SN dopamine neurons. Here we tested the contribution of M5 muscarinic receptors to morphine-induced dopamine elevations by measuring nucleus accumbens dopamine efflux in response to intra-VTA morphine infusion using in vivo chronoamperometry. Intra-VTA morphine increased nucleus accumbens dopamine efflux in urethane-anesthetized wildtype mice starting at 10 min after infusion. These increases were absent in M5 knockout mice and were similarly blocked by pre-treatment with VTA scopolamine in wildtype mice. Furthermore, in wildtype mice electrical stimulation of the PPT evoked an initial, short-lasting increase in striatal dopamine efflux, followed 5 min later by a second prolonged increase in dopamine efflux. In M5 knockout mice, or following systemic pre-treatment with scopolamine in wildtype mice, the prolonged increase in striatal dopamine efflux was absent. The time course of increased accumbal dopamine efflux in wildtype mice following VTA morphine was consistent with both the prolonged M5-mediated excitation of striatal dopamine efflux following PPT electrical stimulation and accumbal dopamine efflux following LDT electrical stimulation. Therefore, M5 receptors appear critical for prolonged PPT excitation of dopamine efflux and for dopamine efflux induced by intra-VTA morphine.},

  abstract = {One or more brief seizures can serve to activate endogenous protective programmes which render brain regions temporarily less susceptible to damage following an otherwise harmful episode of status epilepticus (a prolonged seizure). Epileptic tolerance has been demonstrated using a variety of seizure preconditioning paradigms, including electroconvulsive shocks and low doses of excitotoxins such as kainic acid. The cell and molecular mechanisms underlying the protection are not fully understood but proposed mediators include the transcription factor Nf\ensuremath{\kappa}B, altered ion channel expression, upregulation of growth factors and other protective genes, and suppression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Application of microarrays to profile the transcriptome of seizure-preconditioning and tolerance has provided further insights, including roles for chromatin remodeling and evidence that preconditioning generates an anti-excitotoxicity phenotype by reprogramming the transcriptional response to status epilepticus. This review summarizes the various animal models of epileptic tolerance, reviews the key effector(s) and the utility of this experimental paradigm for identifying novel targets for neuroprotection and anti-epileptogenesis.},

  issn = {1935-861X},
  doi = {10.1016/j.brs.2012.10.006},
  abstract = {Background
Task switching, defined as the ability to flexibly switch between tasks in the face of goal shifting, is a central mechanism in cognitive control. Task switching is thought to involve both prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal regions. Our previous work has shown that it is possible to modulate set shifting tasks using 1~mA~tDCS on both the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left primary motor area. However, it remains unclear whether the effects of PFC tDCS on task switching are hemisphere-dependent.
Objectives
We aimed to test the effects of three types of cross-hemispheric tDCS over the PFC (left anode\textendash{}right cathode [LA-RC], left cathode\textendash{}right anode [LC-RA] and sham stimulation) on participants' performance (reaction time) and accuracy (correct responses) in two task-switching paradigms (i.e.,~letter/digit naming and vowel\textendash{}consonant/parity tasks).
Methods
Sixteen participants received cross-hemispheric tDCS over the PFC in two task-switching paradigms.
Results
The results show that cross-hemispheric tDCS over the PFC modulates task-switching ability in both paradigms. Our results were task and hemisphere-specific, such that in the letter/digit naming task, LA-RC tDCS increased switching performance, whereas LC-RA tDCS improved accuracy. On the other hand, in the vowel\textendash{}consonant/parity task, LA-RC improved accuracy, and decreased switching performance.
Conclusions
Our findings confirm the notion that involvement of the PFC on task switching depends critically on laterality, implying the existence of different roles for the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere in task switching.},

  abstract = {Previous rodent studies have implicated the infralimbic (IL) subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex in extinction of auditory fear conditioning. However, these studies used pharmacological inactivation or electrical stimulation techniques, which lack temporal precision and neuronal specificity. Here, we used an optogenetic approach to either activate (with channelrhodopsin) or silence (with halorhodopsin) glutamatergic IL neurons during conditioned tones delivered in one of two phases: extinction training or extinction retrieval. Activating IL neurons during extinction training reduced fear expression and strengthened extinction memory the following day. Silencing IL neurons during extinction training had no effect on within-session extinction, but impaired the retrieval of extinction the following day, indicating that IL activity during extinction tones is necessary for the formation of extinction memory. Surprisingly, however, silencing IL neurons optogenetically or pharmacologically during the retrieval of extinction 1 day or 1 week following extinction training had no effect. Our findings suggest that IL activity during extinction training likely facilitates storage of extinction in target structures, but contrary to current models, IL activity does not appear to be necessary for retrieval of extinction memory.},

Previous network models for sequences and memory emphasized specialized architectures in which a principled mechanism is pre-wired into their connectivity. Here we demonstrate that, starting from random connectivity and modifying a small fraction of connections, a largely disordered recurrent network can produce sequences and implement working memory efficiently. We use this process, called Partial In-Network Training (PINning), to model and match cellular resolution imaging data from the posterior parietal cortex during a virtual memory-guided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis of the connectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the cooperation between recurrent synaptic interactions and external inputs, rather than through feedforward or asymmetric connections. Together our results suggest that neural sequences may emerge through learning from largely unstructured network architectures.},

Our aim was to determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, which enhances brain cortical excitability and activity, would modify performance in a sequential-letter working memory task when administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fifteen subjects underwent a three-back working memory task based on letters. This task was performed during sham and anodal stimulation applied over the left DLPFC. Moreover seven of these subjects performed the same task, but with inverse polarity (cathodal stimulation of the left DLPFC) and anodal stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1). Our results indicate that only anodal stimulation of the left prefrontal cortex, but not cathodal stimulation of left DLPFC or anodal stimulation of M1, increases the accuracy of the task performance when compared to sham stimulation of the same area. This accuracy enhancement during active stimulation cannot be accounted for by slowed responses, as response times were not changed by stimulation. Our results indicate that left prefrontal anodal stimulation leads to an enhancement of working memory performance. Furthermore, this effect depends on the stimulation polarity and is specific to the site of stimulation. This result may be helpful to develop future interventions aiming at clinical benefits.},

Metaplasticity is induced by synaptic or cellular activity, but it is not necessarily expressed as a change in the efficacy of normal synaptic transmission. Instead, it is manifest as a change in the ability to induce subsequent synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation or depression. Thus, metaplasticity is a higher-order form of synaptic plasticity. Metaplasticity might involve alterations in NMDA-receptor function in some cases, but there are many other candidate mechanisms. The induction of metaplasticity complicates the interpretation of many commonly studied aspects of synaptic plasticity, such as saturation and biochemical correlates.},

  abstract = {Conventional wisdom dictates we must face our fears to conquer them. This idea is embodied in exposure-based treatments for anxiety disorders, where the intent of exposure is to reverse a history of avoidant behavior that is thought to fuel a patient's irrational fears. We tested in humans the relationship between fear and avoidance by combining Pavlovian differential fear conditioning with a novel task for quantifying spontaneous passive avoidant behavior. During self-guided navigation in virtual reality following de novo fear conditioning, we observed participants keeping their distance from the feared object. At the individual level, passive avoidant behavior was highly associated with maladaptive fear expression (fear-potentiated startle) during late extinction training, indicating that extinction learning was impaired following a brief episode of avoidance. Avoidant behavior, however, was not related to initial acquired fear, raising doubt about a straightforward link between physiological fear and behavioral avoidance. We conclude that a deeper understanding of what motivates avoidance may offer a target for early intervention, before fears transition from the rational to the irrational.},

This synaptic cooperation occurs within a time window of 30\,min, suggesting that synaptic integration at amygdala synapses can occur within large time windows. Interestingly, we found that synaptic cooperation is not symmetrical. Reinforcement of a thalamic E-LTP by subsequent cortical stimulation is only observed within a shorter time window. We found that activation of endocannabinoid CB1 receptors is involved in the time restriction of thalamic and cortical synaptic cooperation in an activity-dependent manner. Our results support the hypothesis that synaptic cooperation can underlie associative learning and that synaptic tagging and capture is a general mechanism in synaptic plasticity.},

Among these, agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons are thought to promote feeding and weight gain; however, the evidence supporting this view is incomplete. Using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) technology to provide specific and reversible regulation of neuronal activity in mice, we have demonstrated that acute activation of AgRP neurons rapidly and dramatically induces feeding, reduces energy expenditure, and ultimately increases fat stores. All these effects returned to baseline after stimulation was withdrawn. In contrast, inhibiting AgRP neuronal activity in hungry mice reduced food intake. Together, these findings demonstrate that AgRP neuron activity is both necessary and sufficient for feeding. Of interest, activating AgRP neurons potently increased motivation for feeding and also drove intense food-seeking behavior, demonstrating that AgRP neurons engage brain sites controlling multiple levels of feeding behavior. Due to its ease of use and suitability for both acute and chronic regulation, DREADD technology is ideally suited for investigating the neural circuits hypothesized to regulate energy balance.},

In Experiment 1, we used a 3-day (20 min/d) mindfulness meditation intervention and measured pain ratings before and after the intervention. Participants' numerical ratings of pain to "low" and "high" electrical stimulation significantly decreased after meditation training. Pain sensitivity, measured by change in stimulus intensity thresholds, also decreased after training. We investigated, in Experiment 2, how well relaxation and a math distraction task attenuated experimental pain. Math distraction but not relaxation reduced high pain ratings. There was no reduction in pain sensitivity in these participants. In Experiment 3, we directly compared the effects of meditation with math distraction and relaxation conditions. Our findings indicated significant effects of both meditation and math distraction. Consistent with what was observed in Experiment 1, these participants also demonstrated a decrease in pain sensitivity after meditation training. Changes in the mindfulness and anxiety assessments suggest that meditation's analgesic effects are related to reduced anxiety and the enhanced ability to focus on the present moment.
PERSPECTIVE: Our findings indicate that a brief 3-day mindfulness meditation intervention was effective at reducing pain ratings and anxiety scores when compared with baseline testing and other cognitive manipulations. The brief meditation training was also effective at increasing mindfulness skills.},

Criteria for establishing the necessity and sufficiency of such plasticity in mediating trace storage have been identified and are here reviewed in relation to new work using some of the diverse techniques of contemporary neuroscience. Evidence derived using optical imaging, molecular-genetic and optogenetic techniques in conjunction with appropriate behavioural analyses continues to offer support for the idea that changing the strength of connections between neurons is one of the major mechanisms by which engrams are stored in the brain.},

  abstract = {Competing mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in principal neurons of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are thought to underlie the acquisition and consolidation of fear memories, and their subsequent extinction. However, no study to date has examined the locus of action and/or the cellular mechanism(s) by which these processes interact. Here, we report that synaptic plasticity in the cortical pathway onto BLA principal neurons is frequency-dependent and shows a transition from LTD to LTP at stimulation frequencies of \ensuremath{\sim}10~Hz. At the crossover point from LTD to LTP induction we show that concurrent activation of D1 and group II metabotropic glutamate (mGluR2/3) receptors act to nullify any net change in synaptic strength. Significantly, blockade of either D1 or mGluR2/3 receptors unmasked 10~Hz stimulation-induced LTD and LTP, respectively. Significantly, prior activation of presynaptic D1 receptors caused a time-dependent attenuation of mGluR2/3-induced depotentiation of previously induced LTP. Furthermore, studies with cell type-specific postsynaptic transgene expression of designer receptors activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) suggest that the interaction results via bidirectional modulation of adenylate cyclase activity in presynaptic glutamatergic terminals. The results of our study raise the possibility that the temporal sequence of activation of either presynaptic D1 receptors or mGluR2/3 receptors may critically regulate the direction of synaptic plasticity in afferent pathways onto BLA principal neurons. Hence, the interaction of these two neurotransmitter systems may represent an important mechanism for bidirectional metaplasticity in BLA circuits and thus modulate the acquisition and extinction of fear memory.},

Past studies have suggested a role for the habenula in voluntary exercise motivation and reinforcement of intracranial self-stimulation but have not assigned these effects to specific habenula subnuclei. Here, we have developed a genetic model in which neurons of the dorsal medial habenula (dMHb) are developmentally eliminated, via tissue-specific deletion of the transcription factor Pou4f1 (Brn3a). Mice with dMHb lesions perform poorly in motivation-based locomotor behaviors, such as voluntary wheel running and the accelerating rotarod, but show only minor abnormalities in gait and balance and exhibit normal levels of basal locomotion. These mice also show deficits in sucrose preference, but not in the forced swim test, two measures of depression-related phenotypes in rodents. We have also used Cre recombinase-mediated expression of channelrhodopsin-2 and halorhodopsin to activate dMHb neurons or silence their output in freely moving mice, respectively. Optical activation of the dMHb in vivo supports intracranial self-stimulation, showing that dMHb activity is intrinsically reinforcing, whereas optical silencing of dMHb outputs is aversive. Together, our findings demonstrate that the dMHb is involved in exercise motivation and the regulation of hedonic state, and is part of an intrinsic reinforcement circuit.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine links between childhood mental ability and dementia using data from a 1932 survey of the mental ability of the 1921 Scottish birth cohort.
METHOD: Patients with dementia from the 1921 Scottish birth cohort were located in 1) a national survey of early-onset dementia (1974-1988), 2) local mental health services, and 3) a survey of 264 of 519 surviving Aberdeen residents who took the 1932 test. Control subjects were identified in the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey.
RESULTS: Mean 1932 ability score for the Scottish 1921 cohort did not differ from early-onset dementia. Early-onset dementia was not associated with lower childhood mental ability when compared with matched control subjects. In Aberdeen, mental ability scores were significantly lower in children who eventually developed late-onset dementia when compared with other Aberdeen children tested in 1932. This difference was also detected between cases and tested subjects (controls) alive in 1994.
CONCLUSIONS: Late-onset dementia is associated with lower mental ability scores in childhood. Early-onset dementia mental ability scores did not differ from locally matched control subjects or from late-onset dementia. Mechanisms that account for the link between lower mental ability and late-onset dementia are probably not relevant to early-onset dementia.},

Since then, visualization and reconstruction of serial thin sections have provided three-dimensional contexts in which to understand how synapses are modified with plasticity, learning, and sensory input [\textendash{}]. Three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) has proven invaluable for the comprehensive analysis of structural synaptic plasticity. It has provided the needed nanometer resolution to localize and measure key subcellular structures, such as the postsynaptic density (PSD) and presynaptic vesicles which define a synapse, polyribosomes as sites of local protein synthesis, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) for local regulation of calcium and trafficking of membrane proteins, endosomes for recycling, and fine astroglial processes at the perimeter of some synapses. Thus, ssEM is an essential tool for nanoscale analysis of the cell biological and anatomical modifications that underlie changes in synaptic strength. Here we discuss several important issues associated with interpreting the functional significance of structural synaptic plasticity, especially during long-term potentiation, a widely studied cellular model of learning and memory.},

We developed a high-throughput method to quantify yeast sporulation efficiency and used this technique to analyze a line cross between a high-efficiency oak tree isolate and a low-efficiency wine strain. We find that natural variation in sporulation efficiency mirrors natural variation in higher eukaryotes: it shows divergence between isolated populations, arises from loci of major effect, and exhibits epistasis. We show that the lower sporulation efficiency of the wine strain results from a failure to initiate sporulation, rather than from slower kinetics of meiosis and spore formation. The two strains differentially regulate many genes involved in aerobic respiration, an essential pathway for sporulation, such that the oak tree strain appears better poised to generate energy from this pathway. We also report that a polymorphism in RME1 that affects sporulation efficiency in laboratory strains also cosegregates with significant phenotypic differences in our cross of natural isolates. These results lay the groundwork for the study of variation in sporulation efficiency among natural isolates of yeast.},

  abstract = {Under certain conditions, regenerative voltage spikes can be initiated locally in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These are interesting events that could potentially provide neurons with additional computational abilities. Using whole-cell dendritic recordings from the distal apical trunk and proximal tuft regions and realistic computer modeling, we have determined that highly synchronized and moderately clustered inputs are required for dendritic spike initiation: approximately 50 synaptic inputs spread over 100 mum of the apical trunk/tuft need to be activated within 3 msec. Dendritic spikes are characterized by a more depolarized voltage threshold than at the soma [-48 +/- 1 mV (n = 30) vs -56 +/- 1 mV (n = 7), respectively] and are mainly generated and shaped by dendritic Na+ and K+ currents. The relative contribution of AMPA and NMDA currents is also important in determining the actual spatiotemporal requirements for dendritic spike initiation. Once initiated, dendritic spikes can easily reach the soma, but their propagation is only moderately strong, so that it can be modulated by physiologically relevant factors such as changes in the V(m) and the ionic composition of the extracellular solution. With effective spike propagation, an extremely short-latency neuronal output is produced for greatly reduced input levels. Therefore, dendritic spikes function as efficient detectors of specific input patterns, ensuring that the neuronal response to high levels of input synchrony is a precisely timed action potential output.},

We used transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), a method that can selectively inhibit or excitate neuronal populations by modulating GABAergic (anodal stimulation) and glutamatergic (cathodal stimulation) activity [5, 6]. We trained subjects for 6 days with artificial numerical symbols, during which we applied concurrent TDCS to the parietal lobes. The polarity of the brain stimulation specifically enhanced or impaired the acquisition of automatic number processing and the mapping of number into space, both important indices of numerical proficiency [7-9]. The improvement was still present 6 months after the training. Control tasks revealed that the effect of brain stimulation was specific to the representation of artificial numerical symbols. The specificity and longevity of TDCS on numerical abilities establishes TDCS as a realistic tool for intervention in cases of atypical numerical development or loss of numerical abilities because of stroke or degenerative illnesses.},

We found that learning-induced plasticity of local parvalbumin (PV) basket cells was specifically required for long-term, but not short/intermediate-term, memory consolidation in mice. PV plasticity, which involves changes in PV and GAD67 expression and connectivity onto PV neurons, was regulated by cAMP signaling in PV neurons. Following induction, PV plasticity depended on local D1/5 dopamine receptor signaling at 0\textendash{}5 h to regulate its magnitude, and at 12\textendash{}14 h for its continuance, ensuring memory consolidation. D1/5 dopamine receptor activation selectively induced DARPP-32 and ERK phosphorylation in PV neurons. At 12\textendash{}14 h, PV plasticity was required for enhanced sharp-wave ripple densities and c-Fos expression in pyramidal neurons. Our results reveal general network mechanisms of long-term memory consolidation that requires plasticity of PV basket cells induced after acquisition and sustained subsequently through D1/5 receptor signaling.},

To study the relationship of practice-induced gray matter changes and neural activation, we conducted a combined longitudinal functional and morphometric (voxel-based morphometry) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study on mirror reading. Compared with normal reading, mirror reading resulted in an activation of the dorsolateral occipital cortex, medial occipital cortex, superior parietal cortex, medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as anterior insula and cerebellum. Daily practice of 15 min for 2 weeks resulted in an increased performance of mirror reading. After correction for pure performance effects, we found a practice-related decrease of activation at the right superior parietal cortex and increase of activation at the right dorsal occipital cortex. The longitudinal voxel-based morphometry analysis yielded an increase of gray matter in the right dorsolateral occipital cortex that corresponded to the peak of mirror-reading-specific activation. This confirms that short-term gray matter signal increase corresponds to task-specific processing. We speculate that practice-related gray matter signal changes in MRI are primarily related to synaptic remodeling within specific processing areas.},

  abstract = {Neurocomputational models hold that sparse distributed coding is the most efficient way for hippocampal neurons to encode episodic memories rapidly. We investigated the representation of episodic memory in hippocampal neurons of nine epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial monitoring as they discriminated between recently studied words (targets) and new words (foils) on a recognition test. On average, single units and multiunits exhibited higher spike counts in response to targets relative to foils, and the size of this effect correlated with behavioral performance. Further analyses of the spike-count distributions revealed that (i) a small percentage of recorded neurons responded to any one target and (ii) a small percentage of targets elicited a strong response in any one neuron. These findings are consistent with the idea that in the human hippocampus episodic memory is supported by a sparse distributed neural code.},

  abstract = {Alcohol is likely to affect neurons nonselectively, and the understanding of its action in the CNS requires elucidation of underlying neuronal circuits and associated cellular processes. We have identified a Drosophila signaling system, comprising neurons expressing neuropeptide F (NPF, a homolog of mammalian neuropeptide Y) and its receptor, NPFR1, that acutely mediates sensitivity to ethanol sedation. Flies deficient in NPF/NPFR1 signaling showed decreased alcohol sensitivity, whereas those overexpressing NPF exhibited the opposite phenotype. Furthermore, controlled functional disruption of NPF or NPFR1 neurons in adults rapidly confers resistance to ethanol sedation. Finally, the NPF/NPFR1 system selectively mediates sedation by ethanol vapor but not diethyl ether, indicating that the observed NPF/NPFR1 activity reflects a specialized response to alcohol sedation rather than a general response to intoxication by sedative agents. Together, our results provide the molecular and neural basis for the strikingly similar alcohol-responsive behaviors between flies and mammals.},

Furthermore, the mGluR-dependent LTP may involve activation of other receptors, in particular, activation of NMDAR, dopamine and adenosine receptors. mGluR-dependent LTP can be expressed presynaptically or postsynaptically, and can involve a range of intracellular mediators including protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA), tyrosine kinase Src and nitric oxide (NO).},

Recent advent of imaging technology based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has allowed the direct monitoring of the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling activity in spines and dendrites during synaptic plasticity. In particular, the activity of three small GTPase proteins HRas, Cdc42, and RhoA, which share similar structure and mobility on the plasma membrane, displayed different spatial spreading patterns: Cdc42 is compartmentalized in the stimulated spines while RhoA and HRas spread into dendrites over 5-10 \ensuremath{\mu}m. These measurements thus provide the basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling activity. Further, using spatiotemporally controlled spine stimulations, some of the roles of signal spreading have been revealed.},

As increases in mesolimbic dopamine release and locomotion have been implicated as being critical aspects of drug-seeking and reward-related behaviors, the present study sought to determine the relationship between morphine-induced changes in locomotion and mesolimbic dopamine release. Freely moving microdialysis of the ventral striatum was performed in mouse strains chosen on the basis of their documented differences in locomotor and reward response to morphine (C57BL6 and DBA2) and use in the production of genetically modified mice (129Sv). Both C57BL6 and 129Sv mice showed significant increases in locomotion and ventral striatal extracellular dopamine levels following subcutaneous morphine administration (3~mg/kg), with the former strain showing the largest increase in both parameters. Ventral striatal extracellular DA levels increased in DBA2 mice to a similar extent as 129Sv mice following morphine administration, despite this strain showing no locomotor response. Intra-strain analysis found no correlation between morphine-induced locomotion and mesolimbic dopamine release in any of the strains studied. Thus, no universal relationship between morphine-induced mesolimbic dopamine release and locomotion exists between, and particularly within, inbred mouse strains. Furthermore, morphine-induced increases in mesolimbic activity correlate negatively with the rewarding potential of morphine described in previously reported conditioned place preference studies.},

We developed a high-throughput method to quantify yeast sporulation efficiency and used this technique to analyze a line cross between a high-efficiency oak tree isolate and a low-efficiency wine strain. We find that natural variation in sporulation efficiency mirrors natural variation in higher eukaryotes: it shows divergence between isolated populations, arises from loci of major effect, and exhibits epistasis. We show that the lower sporulation efficiency of the wine strain results from a failure to initiate sporulation, rather than from slower kinetics of meiosis and spore formation. The two strains differentially regulate many genes involved in aerobic respiration, an essential pathway for sporulation, such that the oak tree strain appears better poised to generate energy from this pathway. We also report that a polymorphism in RME1 that affects sporulation efficiency in laboratory strains also cosegregates with significant phenotypic differences in our cross of natural isolates. These results lay the groundwork for the study of variation in sporulation efficiency among natural isolates of yeast.},

 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) trials for major depressive disorder (MDD) have shown positive but mixed results.Objective~ 
 To assess the combined safety and efficacy of tDCS vs a common pharmacological treatment (sertraline hydrochloride, 50 mg/d).Design~ 
 Double-blind, controlled trial. Participants were randomized using a 2~\texttimes{}~2 factorial design to sertraline/placebo and active/sham tDCS.Setting~ 
 Outpatient, single-center academic setting in S{\~a}o Paulo, Brazil.Participants~ 
 One hundred twenty antidepressant-free patients with moderate to severe, nonpsychotic, unipolar MDD.Interventions~ 
 Six-week treatment of 2-mA anodal left/cathodal right prefrontal tDCS (twelve 30-minute sessions: 10 consecutive sessions once daily from Monday to Friday plus 2 extra sessions every other week) and sertraline hydrochloride (50 mg/d).Main Outcome Measures~ 
 In this intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome measure was the change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at 6 weeks (end point). We considered a difference of at least 3 points to be clinically relevant. The analysis plan was previously published. Safety was measured with an adverse effects questionnaire, the Young Mania Rating Scale, and cognitive assessment. Secondary measures were rates of clinical response and remission and scores on other scales.Results~ 
 At the main end point, there was a significant difference in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores when comparing the combined treatment group (sertraline/active tDCS) vs sertraline only (mean difference, 8.5 points; 95\% CI, 2.96 to 14.03; P~=~.002), tDCS only (mean difference, 5.9 points; 95\% CI, 0.36 to 11.43; P~=~.03), and placebo/sham tDCS (mean difference, 11.5 points; 95\% CI, 6.03 to 17.10; P~\ensuremath{<}~.001). Analysis of tDCS only vs sertraline only presented comparable efficacies (mean difference, 2.6 points; 95\% CI, -2.90 to 8.13; P~=~.35). Use of tDCS only (but not sertraline only) was superior to placebo/sham tDCS. Common adverse effects did not differ between interventions, except for skin redness on the scalp in active tDCS (P~=~.03). There were 7 episodes of treatment-emergent mania or hypomania, 5 occurring in the combined treatment group.Conclusions and Relevance~ 
 In MDD, the combination of tDCS and sertraline increases the efficacy of each treatment. The efficacy and safety of tDCS and sertraline did not differ.Trial Registration~

When rabbits froze, there were specific changes in the interactions of close-lying amygdalar neurons as compared with other states; these changes were not seen in the spike activity of individual neurons. Freezing increased the numbers of short-latency (up to 100 msec) excitatory connections and decreased the numbers of long-latency (250\textendash{}450 msec) inhibitory connections. Neuron interactions were seen at frequencies in the delta2 range (2\textendash{}4 Hz) more often in this state than in others. When the animals made active motor responses to the stimulus, there were decreases in the numbers of interacting neurons and increases in the numbers of longlatency (200\textendash{}250 msec) excitatory and short-latency (50\textendash{}200 msec) inhibitory connections, and a greater proportion of interactions occurred at frequencies of the theta1 range more frequently than in other states.

Of particular interest are their roles in emergent cortical computations such as binocular integration in primary visual cortex (V1). We measured the binocular response selectivity of genetically defined subpopulations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons received strong inputs from both eyes but lacked selectivity for binocular disparity. Because broad selectivity could result from heterogeneous synaptic input from neighboring neurons, we examined how individual PV+ interneuron selectivity compared to that of the local neuronal network, which is primarily composed of excitatory neurons. PV+ neurons showed functional similarity to neighboring neuronal populations over spatial distances resembling measurements of synaptic connectivity. On the other hand, excitatory neurons expressing CaMKII\ensuremath{\alpha} displayed no such functional similarity with the neighboring population. Our findings suggest that broad selectivity of PV+ interneurons results from nonspecific integration within local networks. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

Recent studies have identified sensory stimulation-evoked spine calcium signals in cortical neurons in vivo. However, spine signaling during ongoing cortical activity in the absence of sensory input, which is essential for important functions like memory consolidation, is not well understood. Here, by using in vivo two-photon imaging of auditory cortical neurons, we demonstrate that subthreshold, NMDA-receptor-dependent spine calcium signals are abundant during up states, but almost absent during down states. In each neuron, about 500 nonclustered spines, which are widely dispersed throughout the dendritic field, are on average active during an up state. The same subset of spines is reliably active during both sensory stimulation and up states. Thus, spontaneously recurring up states evoke in these spines ``patterned'' calcium activity that may control consolidation of synaptic strength following epochs of sensory stimulation.},

  abstract = {Many lines of evidence suggest that memory in the mammalian brain is stored with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Despite recent progresses in identifying neuronal populations involved in memory coding, the synapse-level mechanism is still poorly understood. Computational models and electrophysiological data have shown that functional clustering of synapses along dendritic branches leads to nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs and greatly expands the computing power of a neural network. However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy, we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines. Our findings suggest that clustering of new synapses along dendrites is induced by repetitive activation of the cortical circuitry during learning, providing a structural basis for spatial coding of motor memory in the mammalian brain.},

  abstract = {Summary
Neurotropic viruses that conditionally infect or replicate in molecularly defined neuronal subpopulations, and then spread transsynaptically, are powerful tools for mapping neural pathways. Genetically targetable retrograde transsynaptic tracer viruses are available to map the inputs to specific neuronal subpopulations, but an analogous tool for mapping synaptic outputs is not yet available. Here we describe a Cre recombinase-dependent, anterograde transneuronal tracer, based on the H129 strain of herpes simplex virus (HSV). Application of this virus to transgenic or knockin mice expressing Cre in peripheral neurons of the olfactory epithelium or the retina reveals widespread, polysynaptic labeling of higher-order neurons in the olfactory and visual systems, respectively. Polysynaptic pathways were also labeled from cerebellar Purkinje cells. In each system, the pattern of labeling was consistent with classical circuit-tracing studies, restricted to neurons, and anterograde specific. These data provide proof-of-principle for a conditional, nondiluting anterograde transsynaptic tracer for mapping synaptic outputs from genetically marked neuronal subpopulations.},

  abstract = {Summary
We describe automated technologies to probe the structure of neural tissue at nanometer resolution and use them to generate a saturated reconstruction of a sub-volume of mouse neocortex in which all cellular objects (axons, dendrites, and glia) and many sub-cellular components (synapses, synaptic vesicles, spines, spine apparati, postsynaptic densities, and mitochondria) are rendered and itemized in a database. We explore these data to study physical properties of brain tissue. For example, by tracing the trajectories of all excitatory axons and noting their juxtapositions, both synaptic and non-synaptic, with every dendritic spine we refute the idea that physical proximity is sufficient to predict synaptic connectivity (the so-called Peters' rule). This online minable database provides general access to the intrinsic complexity of the neocortex and enables further data-driven inquiries.

It is unknown, however, how extinction learning-induced changes in mPFC activity are relayed to target structures in the amygdala, resulting in diminished fear responses. Here, we show that fear extinction decreases the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission in projections from the mPFC to the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), whereas inhibitory responses are not altered. In contrast, synaptic strength at direct mPFC inputs to intercalated neurons remains unchanged after extinction. Moreover, priming stimulation of mPFC projections induced heterosynaptic inhibition in auditory cortical inputs to the BLA. These synaptic mechanisms could contribute to the encoding of extinction memory by diminishing the ability of projections from the mPFC to drive BLA activity while retaining the ability of intercalated neurons to inhibit the output nuclei of the amygdala.},

  abstract = {The expression of the voltage-gated K(+)-channel subunit Kv3.1b in the developing hippocampus was determined by immunoblot and immunohistochemical techniques. Kv3.1b protein was detected first at postnatal day (P) 8. The Kv3.1b-immunopositive cell number per tissue section reached a maximum at P14 and was maintained through P40. In contrast, the Kv3.1b protein content of isolated membrane vesicles in immunoblots progressively increased through P40, suggesting an increase in Kv3.1b content per cell throughout this time period. Kv3.1b protein was expressed selectively in the somata, proximal dendrites, and axons of cells lying within or near the pyramidal cell layer, consistent with their being GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Kv3.1b was present in approximately 80\% of parvalbumin-positive interneurons. The developmental onset of Kv3.1b and parvalbumin immunoreactivity was identical. In contrast, Kv3.1b was mostly absent from the subset of somatostatin-positive inhibitory interneurons. Electrophysiological recordings were made from stratum pyramidale interneurons in which morphology and Kv3.1b-positive immunoreactivity were confirmed post hoc. Outward currents had voltage-dependent and biophysical properties resembling those of channels formed by Kv3.1b. The current blocked by low concentrations of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) showed marked inactivation, suggesting that Kv3.1b may coassemble with other members of the Kv3 subfamily. In current-clamp recordings, concentrations of 4-AP that blocked the current through Kv3.1b channels allowed us tentatively to assign a role to Kv3.1b-containing channels in action-potential repolarization. These data demonstrate that Kv3.1b is regulated developmentally in a specific subpopulation of hippocampal interneurons and that channels containing this subunit may be a major determinant in imparting "fast-spiking" characteristics to these and other cells throughout the central nervous system containing the Kv3.1b subunit.},

Locally and acutely increasing MEF2 function in the dentate gyrus blocked both learning-induced increases in spine density and spatial-memory formation. Increasing MEF2 function in amygdala disrupted fear-memory formation. We rescued MEF2-induced memory disruption by interfering with AMPA receptor endocytosis, suggesting that AMPA receptor trafficking is a key mechanism underlying the effects of MEF2. In contrast, decreasing MEF2 function in dentate gyrus and amygdala facilitated the formation of spatial and fear memory, respectively. These bidirectional effects indicate that MEF2 is a key regulator of plasticity and that relieving the suppressive effects of MEF2-mediated transcription permits memory formation.},

In the present study quantitative electron microscopy was used to investigate morphological changes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of 3-month-old male rats at 3, 9 and 24 h after training to find a hidden platform in a Morris water maze. Average escape latency (time taken to reach the platform) in all trained groups decreased progressively with increased training but data from a probe trial (quadrant analysis test) at the end of training indicated that only animals in the 9- and 24-h groups, not the 3-h group, displayed significant retention of platform location. Unbiased stereological methods were used to estimate synapse and neuronal density at each time point after training. The majority of synapses had unperforated postsynaptic densities, were localized on small dendritic spines and were classed as axo-spinous. In comparison to age-matched untrained rats, significant but transient increases were observed in axo-spinous synapse density and synapse-to-neuron ratio 9 h after the start of training, but not at earlier (3 h) or later (24 h) times. These changes at 9 h post-training were accompanied by transient decreases in both mean synaptic height and area of postsynaptic density. No such changes were observed in an exercise-matched control group of rats, indicating that the transient synaptic changes in the dentate gyrus are most likely to be specifically related to processes involved in memory formation for the spatial learning task.},

  abstract = {Many neuropeptides are involved in the control of sexual behaviour at the central level. Among these, the most studied are adrenocorticotropin, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, oxytocin and opioid peptides. This attempt to review old and new neuropharmacological, biochemical and psychobiological studies in this field, shows that all these neuropeptides apparently facilitate sexual behaviour, except for opioid peptides, which inhibit sexual performance, in most of the species studied so far (rats, mice, monkeys and humans). However, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing factor, neuropeptide Y, galanin, cholecystokinin, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide may be also involved in the control of sexual behaviour. Apparently, corticotropin releasing factor, neuropeptide Y and cholecystokinin inhibit, while substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide facilitate, sexual behaviour. In contrast, gonadotropin-releasing hormone has been reported to exert a facilitative, inhibitory or no effect at all on sexual behaviour. Galanin was also shown either to facilitate or inhibit sexual behaviour. The above-mentioned putative role of the neuropeptides in sexual behaviour derives mainly from studies done in rats. In these studies, neuropeptides, their antisera or drugs that act as agonists or antagonists of neuropeptide receptors, were tested for their effect on sexual behaviour after systemic, intracerebroventricular, or intracerebral administration. The latter were infused into brain areas relevant for sexual behaviour, such as the medial preoptic area, and the ventromedial and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. The above studies show that little information is available on the mechanisms by which neuropeptides influence sexual behaviour. Also unclear is whether the above neuropeptides influence the anticipatory phase (sexual arousal and/or motivation) or the consummatory phase (performance) of sexual behaviour, except for opioid peptides. New information about the role of neuropeptides may come from the application of molecular biology and genetic manipulation techniques to the study of sexual behaviour. Of these, FOS protein determination, antisense oligonucleotides aimed at the neutralisation of neuropeptide and/or neuropeptide receptor mRNAs in specific brain areas, and gene ablation seem the most promising. Although still in the early stages, it is likely that these methodologies will provide new insights into the role of neuropeptides in the control of sexual behaviour. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Principal neurons represent the major postsynaptic target of most interneurons; however, a population of interneurons that is dedicated to the selective innervation of GABAergic cells exists in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. The physiological properties of these cells and their functional relevance for network computations remain unknown. Here, we used a combination of dual simultaneous patch-clamp recordings and targeted optogenetic stimulation in acute mouse hippocampal slices to examine how one class of interneuron-specific (IS) cells controls the activity of its GABAergic targets. We found that type 3 IS (IS3) cells that coexpress the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and calretinin contact several distinct types of interneurons within the hippocampal CA1 stratum oriens/alveus (O/A), with preferential innervation of oriens-lacunosum moleculare cells (OLMs) through dendritic synapses. In contrast, VIP-positive basket cells provided perisomatic inhibition to CA1 pyramidal neurons with the asynchronous GABA release and were not connected with O/A interneurons. Furthermore, unitary IPSCs recorded at IS3\textendash{}OLM synapses had a small amplitude and low release probability but summated efficiently during high-frequency firing of IS3 interneurons. Moreover, the synchronous generation of a single spike in several IS cells that converged onto a single OLM controlled the firing rate and timing of OLM interneurons. Therefore, dendritic inhibition originating from IS cells is needed for the flexible activity-dependent recruitment of OLM interneurons for feedback inhibition.},

Training produced improvements in visual discrimination that were linked to increases in perceptual sensitivity and improved vigilance during sustained visual attention.

This cascade is required specifically for NMDA receptor-dependent LTD but not for mGluR-LTD, and its activation is sufficient to induce synaptic depression. In contrast to apoptosis, however, BAD is activated only moderately and transiently and BAX is not translocated to mitochondria, resulting in only modest caspase-3 activation. We further demonstrate that the intensity and duration of caspase-3 activation determine whether it leads to cell death or LTD, thus fine-tuning of caspase-3 activation is critical in distinguishing between these two pathways.},

Opioid receptors are recruited in response to natural rewarding stimuli and drugs of abuse, and both endogenous opioids and their receptors are modified as addiction develops. Mechanisms whereby aberrant activation and modifications of the opioid system contribute to drug craving and relapse remain to be clarified. This review summarizes our present knowledge on brain sites where the endogenous opioid system controls hedonic responses and is modified in response to drugs of abuse in the rodent brain. We review 1) the latest data on the anatomy of the opioid system, 2) the consequences of local intracerebral pharmacological manipulation of the opioid system on reinforced behaviors, 3) the consequences of gene knockout on reinforced behaviors and drug dependence, and 4) the consequences of chronic exposure to drugs of abuse on expression levels of opioid system genes. Future studies will establish key molecular actors of the system and neural sites where opioid peptides and receptors contribute to the onset of addictive disorders. Combined with data from human and nonhuman primate (not reviewed here), research in this extremely active field has implications both for our understanding of the biology of addiction and for therapeutic interventions to treat the disorder.},

Participants alternately viewed a photograph of their beloved and a photograph of a familiar individual, interspersed with a distraction-attention task. Group activation specific to the beloved under the two control conditions occurred in dopamine-rich areas associated with mammalian reward and motivation, namely the right ventral tegmental area and the right postero-dorsal body and medial caudate nucleus. Activation in the left ventral tegmental area was correlated with facial attractiveness scores. Activation in the right anteromedial caudate was correlated with questionnaire scores that quantified intensity of romantic passion. In the left insula-putamen-globus pallidus, activation correlated with trait affect intensity. The results suggest that romantic love uses subcortical reward and motivation systems to focus on a specific individual, that limbic cortical regions process individual emotion factors, and that there is localization heterogeneity for reward functions in the human brain.},

  abstract = {Objective 
The aim of this rat study was to investigate the safety limits of extended transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS may be of therapeutic value in several neuro-psychiatric disorders. For its clinical applicability, however, more stable effects are required, which may be induced by intensified stimulations. 
Methods 
Fifty-eight rats received single cathodal stimulations at 1\textendash{}1000 \ensuremath{\mu}A for up to 270 min through an epicranial electrode (3.5 mm2). Histological evaluation (H\&amp;E) was performed 48 h later. A threshold estimate was calculated from volumes of DC-induced lesions. 
Results 
Brain lesions occurred at a current density of 142.9 A/m2 for durations greater than 10 min. For current densities between 142.9 and 285.7 A/m2, lesion size increased linearly with charge density; with a calculated zero lesion size intercept of 52400 C/m2. Brains stimulated below either this current density or charge density threshold, including stimulations over 5 consecutive days, were morphologically intact. 
Conclusion 
The experimentally determined threshold estimate is two orders of magnitude higher than the charge density currently applied in humans (171\textendash{}480 C/m2). In relation to transcranial DC stimulation in humans the rat epicranial electrode montage may provide for an additional safety margin. 
Significance 
Although these results cannot be directly transferred to humans, they encourage the development intensified tDCS protocols. Further animal studies are required, before such protocols can be applied in humans.},

By varying stimulation parameters, we were able to build a stimulus\textendash{}response map of synaptic plasticity as a LTP\textendash{}LTD continuum. The response curve displayed a bidirectional shift toward LTP and LTD, depending on the degree and timing of neural activity of the basolateral amygdala. The range of this plastic modulation was also modified by past activity of the basolateral amygdala, suggesting that the amygdala can arrange its ability to regulate the dentate plastic responses. The effects of the BLA activation were replicated by stimulation of the lateral perforant path and, hence, BLA stimulation may recruit the lateral entorhinal cortex. These results represent a high-order dimension of heterosynaptic modulations of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.},

Arc/Arg3.1 (Arc) expression is regulated by neural activity and is a critical protein for memory reconsolidation. However, it remains unclear whether memory retrieval alters Arc transcription during subsequent rest. In this study, the populations of mouse lateral amygdala neurons that transcribe Arc during memory retrieval and at rest were detected using Arc cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Arc catFISH). Results demonstrated that memory retrieval alters the composition of neuronal populations, which activate Arc transcription during subsequent rest. Approximately 50\% of neurons that transcribe Arc at subsequent rest, transcribed Arc during memory retrieval, whereas only approximately 10\% of neurons that transcribed Arc during a rest period prior to memory retrieval transcribe Arc during memory retrieval. In contrast, re-exposure to the chamber induced less preferential Arc transcription in latent inhibited mice that received shocks but recalled less conditioned fear. Taken together, these findings indicate that neuronal subpopulations activated during fear memory retrieval preferentially transcribe Arc during subsequent rest in the lateral amygdala. This preferential Arc transcription may contribute to memory reconsolidation.},

  abstract = {The integrative properties of neurons depend strongly on the number, proportions and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs they receive. In this study the three-dimensional geometry of dendritic trees and the density of symmetrical and asymmetrical synapses on different cellular compartments of rat hippocampal CA1 area pyramidal cells was measured to calculate the total number and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on a single cell.A single pyramidal cell has approximately 12,000 microm dendrites and receives around 30,000 excitatory and 1700 inhibitory inputs, of which 40 \% are concentrated in the perisomatic region and 20 \% on dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. The pre- and post-synaptic features suggest that CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites are heterogeneous. Strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are similar and differ from stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites. Proximal apical and basal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are spine-free or sparsely spiny. Distal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites (forming 68.5 \% of the pyramidal cells' dendritic tree) are densely spiny; their excitatory inputs terminate exclusively on dendritic spines, while inhibitory inputs target only dendritic shafts. The proportion of inhibitory inputs on distal spiny strata radiatum and oriens dendrites is low ( approximately 3 \%). In contrast, proximal dendritic segments receive mostly (70-100 \%) inhibitory inputs. Only inhibitory inputs innervate the somata (77-103 per cell) and axon initial segments. Dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare possess moderate to small amounts of spines. Excitatory synapses on stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites are larger than the synapses in other layers, are frequently perforated ( approximately 40 \%) and can be located on dendritic shafts. Inhibitory inputs, whose percentage is relatively high ( approximately 14-17 \%), also terminate on dendritic spines. Our results indicate that: (i) the highly convergent excitation arriving onto the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells is primarily controlled by proximally located inhibition; (ii) the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in layers receiving Schaffer collateral input (radiatum/oriens) versus perforant path input (lacunosum-moleculare) is significantly different.},

No previous report in the rat has comprehensively described the projections of CM. Using the anterograde anatomical tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, we examined the efferent projections of CM, comparing projections from rostral (CMr) and caudal (CMc) regions of CM. We showed that the central medial nucleus distributes substantially to several cortical sites and to a limited number of subcortical structures. The primary CM targets were anterior and posterior regions of cortex, the claustrum, the caudate-putamen, the nucleus accumbens (ACC), the olfactory tubercle, and the amygdala. CMr and CMc distribute to several of the same structures but essentially to different parts of these structures. By comparison, CMr more strongly targets limbic structures, CMc more heavily sensorimotor structures. Main CMr projection sites were the medial agranular, anterior cingulate, prelimbic, dorsolateral orbital and dorsal agranular insular cortices, the dorsal striatum, the ACC, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. Main CMc cortical projection sites were the ventrolateral, lateral and dorsolateral orbital cortices, dorsal, ventral and posterior agranular insular cortices, visceral cortex, primary somatosensory and motor cortices, and perirhinal cortex. Main CMc subcortical projection sites were the dorsal striatum and the lateral, central, anterior cortical, and basomedial nuclei of amygdala. The largely complementary output of CMr and CMc to diverse areas of cortex and to regions of the striatum and amygdala suggest a combined CM influence over a widespread area of the anterior cortex and throughout the dorsal and ventral striatum and the amygdala. CM projections to limbic and sensorimotor structures of the rostral forebrain suggest that CM may serve to integrate affective, cognitive and sensorimotor functions for goal-directed behavior.},

  abstract = {It is generally believed that fear extinction is a form of new learning that inhibits rather than erases previously acquired fear memories. Although this view has gained much support from behavioural and electrophysiological studies, the hypothesis that extinction causes the partial erasure of fear memories remains viable. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy, we investigated how neural circuits are modified by fear learning and extinction by examining the formation and elimination of postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer-V pyramidal neurons in the mouse frontal association cortex. Here we show that fear conditioning by pairing an auditory cue with a footshock increases the rate of spine elimination. By contrast, fear extinction by repeated presentation of the same auditory cue without a footshock increases the rate of spine formation. The degrees of spine remodelling induced by fear conditioning and extinction strongly correlate with the expression and extinction of conditioned fear responses, respectively. Notably, spine elimination and formation induced by fear conditioning and extinction occur on the same dendritic branches in a cue- and location-specific manner: cue-specific extinction causes formation of dendritic spines within a distance of two micrometres from spines that were eliminated after fear conditioning. Furthermore, reconditioning preferentially induces elimination of dendritic spines that were formed after extinction. Thus, within vastly complex neuronal networks, fear conditioning, extinction and reconditioning lead to opposing changes at the level of individual synapses. These findings also suggest that fear memory traces are partially erased after extinction.},

Fourteen subjects with memory problems had an IV inserted and were injected with 250MBq of Tc-99m ECD while listening to a neutral stimulus CD. They then underwent a pre-program baseline SPECT scan. Then subjects were guided through their first meditation session with a CD, during which they received an injection of 925MBq ECD, and underwent a pre-program meditation scan. Subjects completed an 8-week meditation program and underwent the same scanning protocol resulting in a post-program baseline and meditation scan. A region of interest (ROI) template obtained counts in each ROI normalized to whole brain to provide a CBF ratio. Baseline and meditation scans and neuropsychological testing were compared before and after the program. The meditation program resulted in significant increases (p\ensuremath{<} 0.05) in baseline CBF ratios in the prefrontal, superior frontal, and superior parietal cortices. Scores on neuropsychological tests of verbal fluency, Trails B, and logical memory showed improvements after training. This preliminary study evaluated whether an 8-week meditation program resulted in improvements in neuropsychological function and differences in CBF in subjects with memory loss. While the findings are encouraging, there are a number of limitations that can be addressed in future studies with more participants and more detailed analyses.},

  abstract = {Interneurons of the dentate gyrus are a diverse group of neurons that use GABA as their primary neurotransmitter. Morphological studies of these neurons have been challenging since no single neuroanatomical method provides a complete view of these interneurons. However, through the integration of findings obtained from multiple methods, an interesting picture of this complex group of neurons is emerging, and this review focuses on studies in rats and mice. In situ hybridization of mRNAs for the two isoforms of the GABA synthesizing enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67), demonstrates the abundance of GABA neurons in the dentate gyrus and their high concentration in the hilus and along the base of the granule cell layer. Likewise, immunohistochemical studies, particularly of GAD65, demonstrate the rich fields of GABA terminals not only around the somata of granule cells but also in the dendritic regions of the molecular layer. This broad group of GABA neurons and their terminals can be subdivided according to their morphological characteristics, including the distribution of their axonal plexus, and their neurochemical identity. Intracellular labeling of single interneurons has been instrumental in demonstrating the extensiveness of their axonal plexus and the relatively specific spatial distribution of their axonal fields. These findings have led to the broad classification of interneurons into those that terminate primarily at perisomatic regions and those that innervate the dendrites of granule cells. The interneurons also can be classified according to their neuropeptide and calcium-binding protein content. These and other molecules contribute to the rich diversity of dentate interneurons and may provide opportunities for selectively regulating specific groups of GABA neurons in the dentate gyrus in order to enhance their function or protect vulnerable neurons from damage.},

CREB is a ubiquitous transcription factor implicated in many cellular processes. Which process mediates neuronal memory allocation? One hypothesis is that CREB increases neuronal excitability to bias neuronal recruitment, although this has not been shown experimentally. Here we use several methods to increase neuronal excitability and show this both biases recruitment into the memory trace and enhances memory formation. Moreover, artificial activation of these neurons alone is a sufficient retrieval cue for fear memory expression, showing that these neurons are critical components of the memory trace. These results indicate that neuronal memory allocation is based on relative neuronal excitability immediately before training.,},

In spite of the fact that the amygdala has been implicated in a variety of functions, ranging from attention to memory to emotion, it has not attracted neuroscientists to the same extent as its laminated neighbours, in particular the hippocampus and surrounding cortex. However, recently, principles of information processing within the amygdala, particularly in the rat, have begun to emerge from anatomical, physiological and behavioral studies. These findings suggest that after the stimulus enters the amygdala, the highly organized intra-amygdaloid circuitries provide a pathway by which the representation of a stimulus becomes distributed in parallel to various amygdaloid nuclei. As a consequence, the stimulus representation may become modulated by different functional systems, such as those mediating memories from past experience or knowledge about ongoing homeostatic states. The amygdaloid output nuclei, especially the central nucleus, receive convergent information from several other amygdaloid regions and generate behavioral responses that presumably reflect the sum of neuronal activity produced by different amygdaloid nuclei.},

The HC increase correlated with changes from egocentric to allocentric navigation strategy. GM increases in HC and DLPFC correlated with participants' desire for video gaming, evidence suggesting a predictive role of desire in volume change. Video game training augments GM in brain areas crucial for spatial navigation, strategic planning, working memory and motor performance going along with evidence for behavioral changes of navigation strategy.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mood and motivational symptoms have been reported in up to 35\% and 51\%, respectively, of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Preliminary evidence indicates that pramipexole may have a positive effect on these symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of pramipexole on mood and motivational symptoms in patients with PD.
METHODS: Data for the meta-analysis were extracted from all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of pramipexole in the manufacturer's database that included part I of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) as an outcome measure. Only patients with baseline scores \ensuremath{>}0 (range, 0-4) on item 3 (mood) and item 4 (motivation) were included. Separate analyses were performed for mood and motivational symptoms. The outcome of interest was improvement in scores, with no improvement including both unchanged and increased scores. Odds ratios (ORs), 95\% CIs, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were calculated to compare rates of improvement and no improvement, stratified by trial.
RESULTS: Fourteen randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of pramipexole were identified, all employing the severity of motor symptoms of PD as a primary outcome. Seven of these trials (N = 1296) employed part I of the UPDRS as a secondary outcome measure and were included in the meta-analysis; no other measure of mood or motivational symptoms was used in any of the 14 studies. Six of the 7 studies included patients with motor fluctuations due to levodo-pa treatment, and the remaining study included patients who did not yet require levodopa. Six studies were published in peer-reviewed journals, and all 7 were included in the New Drug Application for pramipexole. The published study reports were usually limited to motor symptoms; only 1 reported on mood and motivation. However, for the purpose of this meta-analysis, the authors had access to data that were not reported in the original publications. In the pooled data set, 480 patients (59.8\% male; mean age, 63.3 years) had a baseline score \ensuremath{>}0 on item 3 (mood). These mood symptoms improved in 64.7\% of patients treated with pramipexole and 43.4\% of those receiving placebo (OR weighted by trial = 2.41; P \ensuremath{<} 0.001). Five hundred seventy patients (64.9\% male; mean age, 64.1 years) had a baseline score \ensuremath{>}0 on item 4 (motivation). These motivational symptoms improved in 63.2\% of patients treated with pramipexole and 45.0\% of those receiving placebo (OR weighted by trial = 2.06; P \ensuremath{<} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials suggests that pramipexole had a beneficial effect on mood and motivational symptoms in PD patients who did not have major depressive disorder. The clinical value of pramipexole in the treatment of depressive and apathetic syndromes requires further investigation.},

Yet there have been no systematic investigations of what types of cognitive damage lead people to appear to no longer be themselves. We measured perceived identity change in patients with three kinds of neurodegenerative disease: frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Structural equation models revealed that injury to the moral faculty plays the primary role in identity discontinuity. Other cognitive deficits, including amnesia, have no measurable impact on identity persistence. Accordingly, frontotemporal dementia has the greatest effect on perceived identity, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has the least. We further demonstrated that perceived identity change fully mediates the impact of neurodegenerative disease on relationship deterioration between patient and caregiver. Our results mark a departure from theories that ground personal identity in memory, distinctiveness, dispositional emotion, or global mental function.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical studies of endogenous concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated conjugate DHEA-S in depression are limited. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of successful pharmacological treatment of late-life depression on concentrations of DHEA, DHEA-S and cortisol. Methods: We determined endogenous concentrations of DHEA, DHEA-S and cortisol in elderly control subjects (n = 16) and in elderly depressed patients who remitted (n = 44) or failed to remit (n = 16) with pharmacological treatment. Depressed patients were treated for 12 weeks with either nortriptyline or paroxetine. Results: In remitters, DHEA and DHEA-S concentrations were lower at week 12 than at week 0 (p = .002 and p = .0001, respectively). In the nonremitters and control subjects, neither DHEA nor DHEA-S concentrations changed. Decreases in hormone concentrations were associated with improvement in mood and functioning in depressed patients. Although cortisol concentrations decreased in remitters and nonremitters, the change was not significant. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the decrease in DHEA and DHEA-S in remitters is related to remission of depression rather than to a direct drug effect on steroids, as nonremitters had no change in hormone concentrations.},

  abstract = {The amygdala is under inhibitory control from the cortex through the activation of local GABAergic interneurons. This inhibition is greatly diminished during heightened emotional states due to dopamine release. However, dopamine excites most amygdala interneurons, suggesting that this dopaminergic gate may be mediated by an unknown subpopulation of interneurons. We hypothesized that this gate is mediated by paracapsular intercalated cells, a subset of interneurons that are innervated by both cortical and mesolimbic dopaminergic afferents. Using transgenic mice that express GFP in GABAergic interneurons, we show that paracapsular cells form a network surrounding the basolateral complex of the amygdala. We found that they provide feedforward inhibition into the basolateral and the central amygdala. Dopamine hyperpolarized paracapsular cells through D1 receptors and substantially suppressed their excitability, resulting in a disinhibition of the basolateral and central nuclei. Suppression of the paracapsular system by dopamine provides a compelling neural mechanism for the increased affective behavior observed during stress or other hyperdopaminergic states.},

  abstract = {Emotion is a key aspect of behavior, enabling humans and animals to assign either positive or negative values to sensory inputs and thereby to make appropriate decisions. Classical experiments in mammalian models, mainly in primates and rodents, have shown that the amygdala is essential for appetitive and aversive associative processing and that dysfunction of this brain region leads to various psychiatric conditions, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobias, autism, and posttraumatic stress disorder. In the past 2 decades, the zebrafish (Danio rerio; Cyprinidae) has emerged as a versatile, reliable vertebrate model organism for the in vivo study of development, gene function, and numerous aspects of human pathologies. Small size, high fecundity, rapid external development, transparency, genetic tractability, and high genetic and physiologic homology with humans are among the factors that have contributed to the success with this small fish in different biomedical research areas. Recent findings indicate that, despite the anatomical differences in the brain structure of teleosts and tetrapods, fish possess a structure homologous to the mammalian amygdala, a hypothesis that is supported by the expression of molecular markers, analyses of neuronal projections in different brain areas, and behavioral studies. This Review summarizes this evidence and highlights a number of relevant bioassays in zebrafish to study emotional memory and motivational behavior. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is a critical component of the neural circuit regulating fear learning. During fear learning and recall, the amygdala and other brain regions, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, exhibit phase-locked oscillations in the high delta/low theta frequency band (\ensuremath{\sim}2\textendash{}6 Hz) that have been shown to contribute to the learning process. Network oscillations are commonly generated by inhibitory synaptic input that coordinates action potentials in groups of neurons. In the rat BLA, principal neurons spontaneously receive synchronized, inhibitory input in the form of compound, rhythmic, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), likely originating from burst-firing parvalbumin interneurons. Here we investigated the role of compound IPSPs in the rat and rhesus macaque BLA in regulating action potential synchrony and spike-timing precision. Furthermore, because principal neurons exhibit intrinsic oscillatory properties and resonance between 4 and 5 Hz, in the same frequency band observed during fear, we investigated whether compound IPSPs and intrinsic oscillations interact to promote rhythmic activity in the BLA at this frequency. Using whole-cell patch clamp in brain slices, we demonstrate that compound IPSPs, which occur spontaneously and are synchronized across principal neurons in both the rat and primate BLA, significantly improve spike-timing precision in BLA principal neurons for a window of \ensuremath{\sim}300 ms following each IPSP. We also show that compound IPSPs coordinate the firing of pairs of BLA principal neurons, and significantly improve spike synchrony for a window of \ensuremath{\sim}130 ms. Compound IPSPs enhance a 5 Hz calcium-dependent membrane potential oscillation (MPO) in these neurons, likely contributing to the improvement in spike-timing precision and synchronization of spiking. Activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling cascade enhanced the MPO, and inhibition of this cascade blocked the MPO. We discuss these results in the context of spike-timing dependent plasticity and modulation by neurotransmitters important for fear learning, such as dopamine.},

Synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) mediates the acquisition of associative memories, both positive and negative. Different populations of BLA neurons may encode fearful or rewarding associations, but the identifying features of these populations and the synaptic mechanisms of differentiating positive and negative emotional valence have remained unknown. Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. We find that photostimulation of NAc projectors supports positive reinforcement while photostimulation of CeM projectors mediates negative reinforcement. Photoinhibition of CeM projectors impairs fear conditioning and enhances reward conditioning. We characterize these functionally distinct neuronal populations by comparing their electrophysiological, morphological and genetic features. Overall, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the representation of positive and negative associations within the amygdala.},

Major classes of identified ubiquitinated proteins include ER-resident membrane proteins, plasma membrane-localized permeases, receptors, and enzymes, and surprisingly, components of the actin cytoskeleton. By determining the differential abundance of ubiquitinated proteins in yeast mutated for NPL4 and UBC7, which are major components of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), we furthermore were able to classify 83 of these identified ubiquitinated membrane proteins as potential endogenous substrates of the ERAD pathway. These substrates are highly enriched for proteins that localize to or transit through the ER. Interestingly, we also identified novel membrane-bound transcription factors that may be subject to ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated cleavage and activation at the ER membrane.},

Arc/Arg3.1 (Arc) expression is regulated by neural activity and is a critical protein for memory reconsolidation.

In this study, the populations of mouse lateral amygdala neurons that transcribe Arc during memory retrieval and at rest were detected using Arc cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Arc catFISH). Results demonstrated that memory retrieval alters the composition of neuronal populations, which activate Arc transcription during subsequent rest. Approximately 50\% of neurons that transcribe Arc at subsequent rest, transcribed Arc during memory retrieval, whereas only approximately 10\% of neurons that transcribed Arc during a rest period prior to memory retrieval transcribe Arc during memory retrieval. In contrast, re-exposure to the chamber induced less preferential Arc transcription in latent inhibited mice that received shocks but recalled less conditioned fear. Taken together, these findings indicate that neuronal subpopulations activated during fear memory retrieval preferentially transcribe Arc during subsequent rest in the lateral amygdala. This preferential Arc transcription may contribute to memory reconsolidation.},

Inhibitory interneurons of the hippocampus, which are essential for information processing, have recently been found to exhibit not one, but two forms of LTP. One form resembles LTP that occurs in pyramidal neurons, which depends on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and is triggered by coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity. The other depends on Ca2+ influx through glutamate receptors that preferentially open when the postsynaptic neuron is at rest. Here we review these contrasting forms of LTP and describe how they are mirrored by two forms of long-term depression. We further discuss how the remarkable plasticity of glutamatergic synapses on interneurons greatly enhances the computational capacity of the cortical microcircuit.},

  abstract = {Understanding how discreet tissues and neuronal circuits function in relation to the whole organism to regulate physiological processes and behaviors is a fundamental goal of modern biological science. Powerful and important new tools in this discovery process are modified G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as `Receptors Activated Solely by Synthetic Ligands (RASSLs),' and `Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by a Designer Drug (DREADDs).' Collectively, these are GPCRs modified either through rational design or directed molecular evolution, that do not respond to native ligand, but functionally respond only to synthetic ligands. Importantly, the utility of these receptors is not limited to examination of the role of GPCR-coupled effector signal transduction pathways. Due to the near ubiquitous expression of GPCRs throughout an organism, this technology, combined with whole animal transgenics to selectively target expression, has the ability to regulate activity of discreet tissues and neuronal circuits through effector pathway modulation to study function and behavior throughout the organism. Advantages over other systems currently used to modify in vivo function include the ability to rapidly, selectively and reversibly manipulate defined signal transduction pathways both in short term and long term studies, and no need for specialized equipment due to convenient systemic treatment with activating ligand.},

This cholinergic complex has been suggested to play a role in sleep, waking, motor function, learning and reward. To have a better understanding of the neurochemical organization of the PPTg/LDTg we characterized the phenotype of PPTg/LDTg neurons by determining in these cells the expression of transcripts encoding choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) or the vesicular glutamate transporters (vGluT1, vGluT2 and vGluT3). Within the PPTg/LDTg complex we found neurons expressing ChAT, vGluT2 or GAD transcripts, these neuronal phenotypes were intermingled, but not homogeneously distributed within the PPTg or LDTg. Previous studies suggested the presence of either glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunolabeling in a large number of PPTg/LDTg cholinergic neurons, leading to the widespread notion that PPTg/LDTg cholinergic neurons co-release acetylcholine together with either glutamate or GABA. To assess the glutamatergic or GABAergic nature of the PPTg/LDTg cholinergic neurons, we combined in situ hybridization (to detect vGluT2 or GAD transcripts) and immunohistochemistry (to detect ChAT), and found that over 95\% of all PPTg/LDTg cholinergic neurons lack transcripts encoding either vGluT2 mRNA or GAD mRNA. As the vast majority of PPTg/LDTg cholinergic neurons lack transcripts encoding essential proteins for the vesicular transport of glutamate or for the synthesis of GABA, co-release of acetylcholine with either glutamate or GABA is unlikely to be a major factor in the interactions between acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA at the postsynaptic site.},

In the 5 min prior to introduction of the female rat, the male rat explores the bilevel testing chamber. It was previously shown that the increase over tests of these anticipatory level changes is sexually motivated and a response to olfactory stimuli. Naloxone infusion into the VTA prevented the increase of anticipatory level changes. beta-Endorphin failed to affect the anticipatory level-changing behavior. The sexual performance was unaffected by naloxone or beta-endorphin treatment, but the number of ejaculating rats decreased with repeated testing after naloxone treatment. It is concluded that endogenous opioid systems in the ventral tegmental area contribute to the stimulation of sexual motivation and/or reward, presumably by stimulating the mesolimbic dopamine system in response to sex-related olfactory stimuli.},

  abstract = {Introduction  When statistical analyses are carried out, it is often neccessary to transform the measured value to make the assumptions used in the statistical analyses valid. When results are reported, the estimated values of e.g. treatment means are often transformed back to the measured or traditional scale. The advantage is that the results become readily comparable with results in similar studies. It has become accepted practice in many scientific journals to indicate the precision of such estimates by the estimated standard error of the estimate. For several reasons a more appropriate approach is to calculate the confidence interval of the estimate, e.g. it often includes the uncertainty in the estimate of the standard error. The argument for use of the standard error is, that it is more compact, i.e. only one value need to be reported, and if the estimates follow the normal distribution, confidence intervals can easily be calculated by means of the standard error.

  abstract = {The calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, was localized immunohistochemically in the human amygdaloid complex. Neuronal cell bodies and fibers that are immunoreactive to parvalbumin were observed in most of the amygdaloid nuclei and cortical areas. Three types of immunoreactive aspiny neurons, ranging from small spherical cells (type 1) to large multipolar cells (type 2) and fusiform cells (type 3), were observed. The densities of the types of neurons that were parvalbumin-immunoreactive varied in the different regions of the amygdala. The highest densities of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons were observed in the lateral nucleus, in the magnocellular and intermediate divisions of the basal nucleus, in the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus and in the amygdalohippocampal area. The regions containing the lowest density of parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells were the paralaminar nucleus, the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus, the central nucleus, the medial nucleus and the anterior cortical nucleus. In general, the distribution of immunoreactive fibers and terminals paralleled that of immunoreactive cells. Parvalbumin-immunoreactive varicose fibers formed basket-like plexi and cartridges around the unstained neurons, which suggests that parvalbumin is located in GABAergic basket cells and chandelier cells, respectively. The distribution of parvalbumin-immunoreactive profiles in the human amygdaloid complex was similar to, rather than different from that previously reported in the monkey amygdala (Pitk{\"a}nen and Amaral [1993] J. Comp. Neurol. 331:14-36). This study provides baseline information about the organization of GABAergic inhibitory circuitries in the human amygdaloid complex.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between exogenous testosterone administration and cognitive abilities in a population of healthy older men.
BACKGROUND: Serum levels of total and bioavailable testosterone gradually decrease with age in men and are associated with reductions in muscle mass, osteoporosis, decreased sexual activity, and changes in cognition.
METHODS: Twenty-five healthy, community-dwelling volunteers, aged 50 to 80 years, completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants received weekly intramuscular injections of either 100 mg testosterone enanthate or placebo (saline) for 6 weeks. Cognitive evaluations were conducted at baseline, week 3, and week 6 of treatment by use of a battery of neuropsychologic tests.
RESULTS: Circulating total testosterone was raised an average of 130\% from baseline at week 3 and 116\% at week 6 in the treatment group. Because of aromatization of testosterone, estradiol increased an average of 77\% at week 3 and 73\% at week 6 in the treatment group. Significant improvements in cognition were observed for spatial memory (recall of a walking route), spatial ability (block construction), and verbal memory (recall of a short story) in older men treated with testosterone compared with baseline and the placebo group, although improvements were not evident for all measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that short-term testosterone administration enhances cognitive function in healthy older men. However, it remains unclear whether these improvements in cognition are attributable to increased testosterone or estradiol levels, or both. The potential role of testosterone vs its metabolites on cognition requires further research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: So far, no comprehensive answer has emerged to the question of whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can make a clinically useful contribution to the treatment of major depression. We aim to present a systematic review and meta-analysis of tDCS in the treatment of depression.
METHOD: Medline and Embase were searched for open-label and randomized controlled trials of tDCS in depression using the expressions ('transcranial direct current stimulation' or 'tDCS') and ('depression' or 'depressed'). Study data were extracted with a standardized data sheet. For randomized controlled trials, effect size (Hedges' g) was calculated and the relationships between study variables and effect size explored using meta-regression.
RESULTS: A total of 108 citations were screened and 10 studies included in the systematic review. Six randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis, with a cumulative sample of 96 active and 80 sham tDCS courses. Active tDCS was found to be more effective than sham tDCS for the reduction of depression severity (Hedges' g=0.743, 95\% confidence interval 0.21-1.27), although study results differed more than expected by chance (Q=15.52, df=6, p=0.017, I2=61.35). Meta-regression did not reveal any significant correlations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study was limited by the small number of studies included, which often had small sample size. Future studies should use larger, if possible representative, health service patient samples, and optimized protocols to evaluate the efficacy of tDCS in the treatment of depression further.},

Brains harvested 6 hr after social defeat were dissected into 12 regions (olfactory bulbs, 3 cortical regions [frontal cortex, cortex above the basal ganglia, cortex above the diencephalon], caudate-putamen, basal forebrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, tectum, tegmentum, and lower brain stem). Neuropeptide radioimmunoassays demonstrated the following statistically significant regional changes in defeated rats as compared with nondefeated rats: CCK-8 was reduced in frontal cortex and cortex overlying diencephalon, the olfactory bulbs, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, tectum, and lower brainstem. Neuropeptide Y was elevated in the caudate-putamen. Substance P was elevated in the cortex over the basal ganglia and decreased in basal forebrain. CRF was diminished in the hippocampus. The results highlight more robust CCK modulation by social defeat as compared with 3 other neuropeptide systems involved in brain emotional regulation.},

  abstract = {Many lines of evidence suggest that memory in the mammalian brain is stored with distinct spatiotemporal patterns(1,2). Despite recent progresses in identifying neuronal populations involved in memory coding(3-5), the synapse-level mechanism is still poorly understood. Computational models and electrophysiological data have shown that functional clustering of synapses along dendritic branches leads to nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs and greatly expands the computing power of a neural network(6-10). However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy(11), we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines. Our findings suggest that clustering of new synapses along dendrites is induced by repetitive activation of the cortical circuitry during learning, providing a structural basis for spatial coding of motor memory in the mammalian brain.},

Indeed, when the ratio of intrinsically excitable cells was increased or decreased, the number of plastic cells remained relatively constant. Analysis of the connectivity of plastic and nonplastic cells revealed that subsets of principal LA neurons effectively band together by virtue of their excitatory interconnections to suppress plasticity in other principal cells via the recruitment of inhibitory interneurons.},

By comparison, little is known about memory allocation, the process that determines which specific neurons in a neural network will store a given memory. Previous studies demonstrated that memory allocation is not random in the amygdala; these studies showed that amygdala neurons with higher levels of the cyclic-AMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) are more likely to be recruited into encoding and storing fear memory. To determine whether specific mechanisms also regulate memory allocation in other brain regions and whether CREB also has a role in this process, we studied insular cortical memory representations for conditioned taste aversion (CTA). In this task, an animal learns to associate a taste (conditioned stimulus [CS]) with the experience of malaise (such as that induced by LiCl; unconditioned stimulus [US]). The insular cortex is required for CTA memory formation and retrieval. CTA learning activates a subpopulation of neurons in this structure, and the insular cortex and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) interact during CTA formation. Here, we used a combination of approaches, including viral vector transfections of insular cortex, arc fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) system, to show that CREB levels determine which insular cortical neurons go on to encode a given conditioned taste memory.},

In control slices, electrical high-frequency conditioning stimulation (CS) could reliably induce LTP. In contrast, the same CS protocol resulted in long-term depression when HFMS was delivered to the slice 30\,min prior to the electrical stimulation. HFMS-priming was diminished when applied in the presence of the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (RS)-\ensuremath{\alpha}-methylserine-O-phosphate (MSOP) and (RS)-\ensuremath{\alpha}-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG). Moreover, when HFMS was delivered in the presence of the NMDA receptor-antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50\,\ensuremath{\mathrm{\mu}}M), CS-induced electrical LTP was again as high as under control conditions in slices without priming. These results demonstrate that HFMS significantly reduced the propensity of subsequent electrical LTP and show that both metabotropic glutamate and NMDA receptor activation were involved in this form of HFMS-induced metaplasticity.},

Despite extensive research in cellular and animal models, identifying the pathogenic agent present in the human brain and showing that it confers key features of AD have not been achieved. We extracted soluble amyloid \ensuremath{\beta}\textendash{}protein (A\ensuremath{\beta}) oligomers directly from the cerebral cortex of typical AD subjects. The oligomers potently inhibited long term potentiation (LTP), enhanced long term depression (LTD), and reduced dendritic spine density in normal rodent hippocampus. Soluble A\ensuremath{\beta} from AD brain also disrupted the memory of a learned behavior in normal rats. These various effects were specifically attributable to A\ensuremath{\beta} dimers. Mechanistically, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) were required for LTD enhancement and NMDA receptors (NMDAR) for spine loss. Co-administering antibodies to the A\ensuremath{\beta} N-terminus prevented the LTP and LTD deficits, whereas antibodies to the mid-region or C-terminus were less effective. Insoluble amyloid plaque cores from AD cortex did not impair LTP unless they were first solubilized to release A\ensuremath{\beta} dimers, suggesting that plaque cores are largely inactive but sequester A\ensuremath{\beta} dimers that are synaptotoxic. We conclude that soluble A\ensuremath{\beta} oligomers extracted from AD brains potently impair synapse structure and function and that dimers are the smallest synaptotoxic species.},

CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) are not homogeneous but rather can be grouped by molecular, morphological, and functional properties. However, less is known about synaptic sources differentiating PCs. Using paired recordings in~vitro, two-photon Ca2+ imaging in~vivo, and computational modeling, we found that~parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PVBCs) evoked greater inhibition in CA1 PCs located in the deep compared to superficial layer of stratum pyramidale. In turn, analysis of reciprocal connectivity revealed more frequent excitatory inputs to PVBCs by~superficial PCs, demonstrating bias in target selection by both the excitatory and inhibitory local connections in CA1. Additionally, PVBCs further segregated among deep PCs, preferentially innervating the amygdala-projecting PCs but receiving preferential excitation from the prefrontal cortex-projecting PCs, thus revealing distinct perisomatic inhibitory interactions between separate output channels. These results demonstrate the presence of heterogeneous PVBC-PC microcircuits, potentially contributing to the sparse and distributed structure of hippocampal network activity.

  abstract = {A long-standing hypothesis termed "Hebbian plasticity" suggests that memories are formed through strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons with correlated activity. In contrast, other theories propose that coactivation of Hebbian and neuromodulatory processes produce the synaptic strengthening that underlies memory formation. Using optogenetics we directly tested whether Hebbian plasticity alone is both necessary and sufficient to produce physiological changes mediating actual memory formation in behaving animals. Our previous work with this method suggested that Hebbian mechanisms are sufficient to produce aversive associative learning under artificial conditions involving strong, iterative training. Here we systematically tested whether Hebbian mechanisms are necessary and sufficient to produce associative learning under more moderate training conditions that are similar to those that occur in daily life. We measured neural plasticity in the lateral amygdala, a brain region important for associative memory storage about danger. Our findings provide evidence that Hebbian mechanisms are necessary to produce neural plasticity in the lateral amygdala and behavioral memory formation. However, under these conditions Hebbian mechanisms alone were not sufficient to produce these physiological and behavioral effects unless neuromodulatory systems were coactivated. These results provide insight into how aversive experiences trigger memories and suggest that combined Hebbian and neuromodulatory processes interact to engage associative aversive learning.},

Memory traces are believed to be ensembles of cells used to store memories. To visualize memory traces, we created a transgenic line that allows for the comparison between cells activated during encoding and expression of a memory. Mice re-exposed to a fear-inducing context froze more and had a greater percentage of reactivated cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 than mice exposed to a novel context. Over time, these differences disappeared, in keeping with the observation that memories become generalized. Optogenetically silencing DG or CA3 cells that were recruited during encoding of a fear-inducing context prevented expression of the corresponding memory. Mice with reduced neurogenesis displayed less contextual memory and less reactivation in CA3~but, surprisingly, normal reactivation in the DG. These studies suggest that distinct memory traces are located in the DG and in CA3 but that the strength of the memory is related to reactivation in CA3.

  abstract = {At least two temporally and mechanistically distinct forms of memory are conserved across many species: short-term memory that persists minutes to hours after training and long-term memory (LTM) that persists days or longer. In general, repeated training trials presented with intervening rest intervals (spaced training) is more effective than massed training (the same number of training trials presented with no or short intervening rest intervals) in producing LTM. LTM requires de novo protein synthesis, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) may be one of the transcription factors regulating the synthesis of new proteins necessary for the formation of LTM. Here we show that rats given massed fear conditioning training show no or weak LTM, as measured by fear-potentiated startle, compared with rats given the same amount of training but presented in a spaced manner. Increasing CREB levels specifically in the basolateral amygdala via viral vector-mediated gene transfer significantly increases LTM after massed fear training. The enhancing effect of CREB overexpression on LTM formation is shown to be specific in terms of biochemistry, anatomy, time course, and the training procedure used. These results suggest that CREB activity in the amygdala serves as a molecular switch for the formation of LTM in fear conditioning.},

  abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that develops following trauma exposure. It is characterized by four symptom clusters: intrusion, avoidance, negative alteration in cognitions and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. Several risk factors have been associated with PTSD, including trauma type and severity, gender and sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, cognitive reserve, pretrauma psychopathology, familial psychiatric history, and genetics. Great strides have been made in understanding the neurobiology of PTSD through animal models and human imaging studies. Most of the animal models have face validity, but they have limitations in the generalization to the human model of PTSD. Newer animal models, such as the "CBC" model, have better validity for PTSD, which takes into account the different components of its diagnostic criteria. To date, fear conditioning and fear extinction animal models have provided support for the hypothesis that PTSD is a dysregulation of the processes related to fear regulation and, especially, fear extinction. More research is needed to further understand these processes as they relate not only to PTSD but also to resilience. Further, this research could be instrumental in the development of novel effective treatments for PTSD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The spatial aspects of brain electrical activity can be assessed by equivalent EEG frequency band generators. We aimed to describe alterations of these EEG generators in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy aging and whether they could serve as predictive markers of AD in subjects at risk.
METHODS: The amplitude and 3-dimensional localization of equivalent EEG sources were evaluated using FFT dipole approximation in 38 mild AD patients, 31 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 24 healthy control subjects.
RESULTS: AD patients showed an increase of delta and theta global field power (GFP), which corresponds to the generalized EEG amplitude, as well as a reduction of alpha GFP when compared to the controls. A decrease of alpha and beta GFP was found in AD patients, as compared to the MCI subjects. With respect to topography in the antero-posterior direction, sources of alpha and beta activity shifted more anteriorly in AD patients compared to both the controls and MCI subjects. No significant difference was found between MCI and controls. Combined alpha and theta GFP were the best discriminating variables between AD patients and controls (84\% correct classification) and AD and MCI subjects (78\% correctly classified). MCI subjects were followed longitudinally (25 months on average) in order to compare differences in baseline EEG variables between MCI subjects who progressed to AD (PMCI) and those who remained stable (SMCI). Compared to SMCI, PMCI had decreased alpha GFP and a more anterior localization of sources of theta, alpha and beta frequency. In a linear discriminant analysis applied on baseline values of the two MCI subgroups, the best predictor of future development of AD was found to be antero-posterior localization of alpha frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: FFT dipole approximation and frequency analysis performed by conventional FFT showed comparable classification accuracy between the studied groups. We conclude that localization and amplitude of equivalent EEG sources could be promising markers of early AD.},

Recent work has shown that stimulation of this pathway is antiapoptotic during development but proapoptotic in mature neurons exposed to excitotoxic or other stress. We now report that excitotoxic (N-methyl-D-aspartate) insults to mature cerebrocortical neurons activate caspase-3, -7, in turn cleaving MEF2A, C, and D isoforms. MEF2 cleavage fragments containing a truncated transactivation domain but preserved DNA-binding domain block MEF2 transcriptional activity via dominant interference. Transfection of constitutively active MEF2 (MEF2C-CA) rescues MEF2 transcriptional activity after N-methyl-D-aspartate insult and prevents neuronal apoptosis. Conversely, dominant-interfering MEF2 abrogates neuroprotection by MEF2C-CA. These results define a pathway to excitotoxic neuronal stress/apoptosis via caspase-catalyzed cleavage of MEF2. Additionally, we show that similar MEF2 cleavage fragments are generated in vivo during focal stroke damage. Hence, this pathway appears to have pathophysiological relevance in vivo.},

  abstract = {1. The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane.2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10-20/sec for 10-15 sec, or 100/sec for 3-4 sec.3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells.4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29\% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57\% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43\%, and of the population spike in 40\%, of all experiments.5. During conditioning at 10-20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (;frequency potentiation'). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation.6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.},

Emerging evidence suggests novel functions in dendrites and at synapses of glutamatergic neurons. CNS regeneration inhibitors target the neuronal actin cytoskeleton to regulate dendritic spine maturation, long-term synapse stability, and Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity.

However, it is unknown whether lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus could have a direct effect on neurotransmitter receptors in the CNS in normal, healthy animals. GABA is the main CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter and is significantly involved in regulating many physiological and psychological processes. Alterations in central GABA receptor expression are implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression, which are highly comorbid with functional bowel disorders. In this work, we show that chronic treatment with L. rhamnosus (JB-1) induced region-dependent alterations in GABAB1b mRNA in the brain with increases in cortical regions (cingulate and prelimbic) and concomitant reductions in expression in the hippocampus, amygdala, and locus coeruleus, in comparison with control-fed mice. In addition, L. rhamnosus (JB-1) reduced GABAA\ensuremath{\alpha}2 mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, but increased GABAA\ensuremath{\alpha}2 in the hippocampus. Importantly, L. rhamnosus (JB-1) reduced stress-induced corticosterone and anxiety- and depression-related behavior. Moreover, the neurochemical and behavioral effects were not found in vagotomized mice, identifying the vagus as a major modulatory constitutive communication pathway between the bacteria exposed to the gut and the brain. Together, these findings highlight the important role of bacteria in the bidirectional communication of the gut\textendash{}brain axis and suggest that certain organisms may prove to be useful therapeutic adjuncts in stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression.},

In the hippocampus, the most prominent expression of NPY is observed in mossy fibers and in GABAergic interneurons. At the same time, expression of Y2 receptors is also increased whereas Y1 receptors are reduced. Similar changes in Y1 and Y2 receptors were observed in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In contrast to the rat, NPY expression is not enhanced in mossy fibers in TLE. In the same tissue, surviving NPY interneurons show marked axonal sprouting into areas innervated by mossy fibers (dentate hilus, stratum lucidum, inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus). Stimulation of presynaptic Y2 receptors inhibits glutamate release, and exert an anticonvulsant action in experimental models. Y1 receptors mediate a weak excitatory component of NPY action. These findings suggest that changes in the NPY system induced by seizures represent an endogenous adaptive mechanism aimed at counteracting hyperexcitability underlying epileptic activity. This concept is strongly supported by evidence that genetically modified rats overexpressing the NPY gene are less susceptible to seizures while deletion of NPY or Y2 receptor genes results in increased susceptibility to seizures.},

  abstract = {Pavlovian fear conditioning is an evolutionary conserved and extensively studied form of associative learning and memory. In mammals, the lateral amygdala (LA) is an essential locus for Pavlovian fear learning and memory. Despite significant progress unraveling the cellular mechanisms responsible for fear conditioning, very little is known about the anatomical organization of neurons encoding fear conditioning in the LA. One key question is how fear conditioning to different sensory stimuli is organized in LA neuronal ensembles. Here we show that Pavlovian fear conditioning, formed through either the auditory or visual sensory modality, activates a similar density of LA neurons expressing a learning-induced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2). While the size of the neuron population specific to either memory was similar, the anatomical distribution differed. Several discrete sites in the LA contained a small but significant number of p-ERK1/2-expressing neurons specific to either sensory modality. The sites were anatomically localized to different levels of the longitudinal plane and were independent of both memory strength and the relative size of the activated neuronal population, suggesting some portion of the memory trace for auditory and visually cued fear conditioning is allocated differently in the LA. Presenting the visual stimulus by itself did not activate the same p-ERK1/2 neuron density or pattern, confirming the novelty of light alone cannot account for the specific pattern of activated neurons after visual fear conditioning. Together, these findings reveal an anatomical distribution of visual and auditory fear conditioning at the level of neuronal ensembles in the LA.},

  abstract = {Sexual behavior is directed by a sophisticated interplay between steroid hormone actions in the brain that give rise to sexual arousability and experience with sexual reward that gives rise to expectations of competent sexual activity, sexual desire, arousal, and performance. Sexual experience allows animals to form instrumental associations between internal or external stimuli and behaviors that lead to different sexual rewards. Furthermore, Pavlovian associations between internal and external stimuli allow animals to predict sexual outcomes. These two types of learning build upon instinctual mechanisms to create distinctive, and seemingly "automated," patterns of sexual response. This article reviews the literature on conditioning and sexual behavior with a particular emphasis on incentive sequences of sexual behavior that move animals from distal to proximal with regard to sexual stimuli during appetitive phases of behavior and ultimately result in copulatory interaction and mating during consummatory phases of behavior. Accordingly, the role of learning in sexual excitement, in behaviors that bring about the opportunity to mate, in courtship and solicitation displays, in sexual arousal and copulatory behaviors, in sexual partner preferences, and the short- and long-term influence of copulatory experience on sexual and reproductive function is examined. Although hormone actions set the stage for sexual activity by generating the ability of animals to become sexually excited and aroused, it is each animal's unique experience with sexual behavior and sexual reward that molds the strength of responses made toward sexual incentives.},

The present modeling studies, conducted over an expanded range of intrinsic excitability in the network, revealed that only excitable PNs that received tone inputs participate in the competition. Strikingly, the number of model PNs integrated into the fear memory trace remained constant despite the much larger range considered, and model runs highlighted several conditioning-induced tone responsive characteristics of the various PN populations. Furthermore, these studies showed that although excitation was important, disynaptic inhibition among PNs is the dominant mechanism that keeps the number of plastic PNs stable despite large variations in the network's excitability. Finally, we found that the overall level of inhibition in the model network determines the number of projection cells integrated into the fear memory trace.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolutionary consequences of love are so important that there must be some long-established biological process regulating it. Recent findings suggest that the serotonin (5-HT) transporter might be linked to both neuroticism and sexual behaviour as well as to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The similarities between an overvalued idea, such as that typical of subjects in the early phase of a love relationship, and obsession, prompted us to explore the possibility that the two conditions might share alterations at the level of the 5-HT transporter.
METHODS: Twenty subjects who had recently (within the previous 6 months) fallen in love, 20 unmedicated OCD patients and 20 normal controls, were included in the study. The 5-HT transporter was evaluated with the specific binding of 3H-paroxetine (3H-Par) to platelet membranes.
RESULTS: The results showed that the density of 3H-Par binding sites was significantly lower in subjects who had recently fallen in love and in OCD patients than in controls.
DISCUSSION: The main finding of the present study is that subjects who were in the early romantic phase of a love relationship were not different from OCD patients in terms of the density of the platelet 5-HT transporter, which proved to be significantly lower than in the normal controls. This would suggest common neurochemical changes involving the 5-HT system, linked to psychological dimensions shared by the two conditions, perhaps at an ideational level.},

To test this idea, we monitored the activity of individual cortical neurons while simultaneously inactivating the hippocampus. Neurons that were active during context fear conditioning were tagged with the long-lasting fluorescent protein H2B-GFP and the light-activated proton pump ArchT. These proteins allowed us to identify encoding neurons several days after learning and silence them with laser stimulation. When tagged CA1 cells were silenced, we found that memory retrieval was impaired and representations in the cortex (entorhinal, retrosplenial, perirhinal) and the amygdala could not be reactivated. Importantly, hippocampal inactivation did not alter the total amount of activity in most brain regions. Instead, it selectively prevented neurons that were active during learning from being reactivated during retrieval. These data provide functional evidence that the hippocampus reactivates specific memory representations during retrieval.},

We identified distinct neuronal populations in the lateral amygdala (LA) of rats that signaled generalized versus cue-specific associations and determined how their distributions switched during fear generalization. Notably, the same LA neurons that were cue specific before the behavioral shift to generalized fear lost their specificity afterwards, thereby tilting the balance of activity toward a greater proportion of generalizing neurons. Neuronal activity in the LA, but not the auditory cortex, was necessary for fear generalization. Furthermore, targeted activation of cAMP\textendash{}PKA signaling in the LA increased neuronal excitability of LA neurons and led to generalized fear. These results provide a cellular basis in the amygdala for the alteration of emotional states from normal to pathological fear.},

  abstract = {Excessive synaptic loss is thought to be one of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta (Abeta), a peptide secreted in an activity-modulated manner by neurons, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by removing dendritic spines, sites of excitatory synaptic transmission. However, issues regarding the subcellular source of Abeta, as well as the mechanisms of its production and actions that lead to synaptic loss, remain poorly understood. In rat organotypic slices, we found that acute overproduction of either axonal or dendritic Abeta reduced spine density and plasticity at nearby ( approximately 5-10 mum) dendrites. The production of Abeta and its effects on spines were sensitive to blockade of action potentials or nicotinic receptors; the effects of Abeta (but not its production) were sensitive to NMDA receptor blockade. Notably, only 30-60 min blockade of Abeta overproduction permitted induction of plasticity. Our results indicate that continuous overproduction of Abeta at dendrites or axons acts locally to reduce the number and plasticity of synapses.},

  abstract = {The basolateral amygdala (BL) is a putative site for regulating anxiety, where inhibition and excitation respectively lead to decreases and increases in anxiety-like behaviors. The BL contains local networks of GABAergic interneurons that are subdivided into classes based on neurochemical content, and are hypothesized to regulate unique functional responses of local glutamatergic projection neurons. Recently it was demonstrated that lesioning a portion of the BL interneuronal population, those interneurons that express neurokinin1 receptors (NK(1r)), resulted in anxiety-like behavior. In the current study, these NK(1r) expressing cells of the BL are further phenotypically characterized, demonstrating approximately 80\% co-expression with GABA thus confirming them as GABAergic interneurons. These NK(1r) interneurons also colocalize with two distinct populations of BL interneurons as defined by the neuropeptide content. Of the NK(1r) positive cells, 41.8\% are also positive for neuropeptide Y (NPY) and 39.7\% of the NK(1r) positive cells are also positive for cholecystokinin (CCK). In addition to enhancing the phenotypic characterization, the extent to which the NK(1r) cells of amygdala nuclei contribute to anxiety-like responses was also investigated. Lesioning the NK(1r) expressing interneurons, with a stable form of substance P (SSP; the natural ligand for NK(1r)) coupled to the targeted toxin saporin (SAP), in the anterior and posterior divisions of the BL was correlated to increased anxiety-like behaviors compared to baseline and control treated rats. Furthermore the phenotypic and regional selectivity of the lesions was also confirmed.},

Despite equivalent self-reported sadness, MT participants demonstrated a distinct neural response, with greater right-lateralized recruitment, including visceral and somatosensory areas associated with body sensation.

  abstract = {Plant proteins have a reduced content of essential amino acids in comparison to animal proteins. A significant reduction of limiting amino acids (methionine, lysine, tryptophan) means lower protein synthesis. In subjects with predominant or exclusive consumption of plant food a higher incidence of hypoproteinemia due to significant reduction of methionine and lysine intakes was observed. On the other hand, lower intake of these amino acids provides a preventive effect against cardiovascular disease via cholesterol regulation by an inhibited hepatic phospholipid metabolism. Vegetarians have a significantly higher intake of non-essential amino acids arginine and pyruvigenic amino acids glycine, alanine, serine. When plant protein is high in non-essential amino acids, down-regulation of insulin and up-regulation of glucagon is a logical consequence. The action of glucagon in the liver is mediated by stimulation of adenyl cyclase that raises cyclic-AMP (adenosine-3,5-monophosphate) concentrations. Cyclic-AMP down-regulates the synthesis of a number of enzymes required for de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis, up-regulates key gluconeogenic enzymes and the LDL receptors and decreases the IGF-1 activity (insulin-like growth factor). Cyclic-AMP thus provides a reduction of atherosclerosis risk factors as well as a retardation of cancer development. A sufficient consumption of plant proteins has the protective effects against chronic degenerative diseases (Tab. 2, Ref. 26).},

The mechanism(s) behind this susceptibility to later development of epilepsy is unclear. Increased synaptic activity during development has been shown to permanently alter excitatory neurotransmission and could be one of the mechanisms involved in this increased susceptibility to the development of epilepsy. In the present study we determine the effect of status-epilepticus induced by lithium/pilocarpine at postnatal day 10 (P10 SE) on the expression of glutamate receptor and transporter mRNAs in hippocampal dentate granule cells and protein levels in dentate gyrus of these animals in adulthood. The results revealed a decrease in glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) mRNA expression and protein levels as well as an increase in protein levels for the excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) in P10 SE rats compared to controls. Expression of glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) mRNA was decreased in both P10 SE rats and identically handled, lithium-injected littermate controls compared to naive animals, and GluR1 protein levels were significantly lower in lithium-controls than in naive rats, suggesting an effect of either the handling or the lithium on GluR1 expression. These changes in EAA receptors and transporters were accompanied by an increased susceptibility to kainic acid induced seizures in P10 SE rats compared to controls. The current data suggest that early-life status-epilepticus can result in permanent alterations in glutamate receptor and transporter gene expression, which may contribute to a lower seizure threshold.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by decreased synapse density in hippocampus and neocortex, and synapse loss is the strongest anatomical correlate of the degree of clinical impairment. Although considerable evidence supports a causal role for the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in AD, a direct link between a specific form of Abeta and synapse loss has not been established. We demonstrate that physiological concentrations of naturally secreted Abeta dimers and trimers, but not monomers, induce progressive loss of hippocampal synapses. Pyramidal neurons in rat organotypic slices had markedly decreased density of dendritic spines and numbers of electrophysiologically active synapses after exposure to picomolar levels of soluble oligomers. Spine loss was reversible and was prevented by Abeta-specific antibodies or a small-molecule modulator of Abeta aggregation. Mechanistically, Abeta-mediated spine loss required activity of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) and occurred through a pathway involving cofilin and calcineurin. Furthermore, NMDAR-mediated calcium influx into active spines was reduced by Abeta oligomers. Partial blockade of NMDARs by pharmacological antagonists was sufficient to trigger spine loss. We conclude that soluble, low-n oligomers of human Abeta trigger synapse loss that can be reversed by therapeutic agents. Our approach provides a quantitative cellular model for elucidating the molecular basis of Abeta-induced neuronal dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Memory consolidation is the process by which a newly formed and unstable memory transforms into a stable long-term memory. It is unknown whether the process of memory consolidation occurs exclusively through the stabilization of memory engrams. By using learning-dependent cell labeling, we identified an increase of synaptic strength and dendritic spine density specifically in consolidated memory engram cells. Although these properties are lacking in engram cells under protein synthesis inhibitor\textendash{}induced amnesia, direct optogenetic activation of these cells results in memory retrieval, and this correlates with retained engram cell\textendash{}specific connectivity. We propose that a specific pattern of connectivity of engram cells may be crucial for memory information storage and that strengthened synapses in these cells critically contribute to the memory retrieval process.
Experimental recovery from retrograde amnesia
When memory researchers induce amnesia, they normally assume that the manipulations prevent the memory engram from effective encoding at consolidation. In accordance with this, Ryan et al. found that after the injection of protein synthesis inhibitors, animals could not retrieve a memory. However, to their surprise, the memory could nevertheless be reactivated by light-induced activation of the neurons tagged during conditioning. Increased synaptic strength that is the result of cellular consolidation is thus not a critical requisite for storing a memory.

  abstract = {The late-phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in hippocampal area CA1 requires gene expression and de novo protein synthesis but it is expressed in an input-specific manner. The 'synaptic tag' theory proposes that gene products can only be captured and utilized at synapses that have been 'tagged' by previous activity. The mechanisms underlying synaptic tagging, and its activity dependence, are largely undefined. Previously, we reported that low-frequency stimulation (LFS) decreases the stability of L-LTP in a cell-wide manner by impairing synaptic tagging. We show here that a phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, blocked homosynaptic and heterosynaptic inhibition of L-LTP by prior LFS. In addition, prior LFS homosynaptically and heterosynaptically impaired chemically induced synaptic facilitation elicited by forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, suggesting that there is a cell-wide dampening of cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling concurrent with phosphatase activation. We propose that prior LFS impairs expression of L-LTP by inhibiting synaptic tagging through its actions on the cAMP/PKA pathway. In support of this notion, we show that hippocampal slices from transgenic mice that have genetically reduced hippocampal PKA activity display impaired synaptic capture of L-LTP. An inhibitor of PKA, KT-5720, also blocked synaptic capture of L-LTP. Moreover, pharmacological activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway can produce a synaptic tag to capture L-LTP expression, resulting in persistent synaptic facilitation. Collectively, our results show that PKA is critical for synaptic tagging and for input-specific L-LTP. PKA-mediated signaling can be constrained by prior episodes of synaptic activity to regulate subsequent L-LTP expression and perhaps control the integration of multiple synaptic events over time.},

  abstract = {The immature brain is exceptionally susceptible to seizures. However, it remains unclear whether seizures occurring during development affect critical processes underlying neural circuit formation, leading to long-term functional consequences. Here we characterize a novel in vivo model system of developmental seizures based on the transparent albino Xenopus laevis tadpole, which allows direct examination of seizure activity, and seizure-induced effects on neuronal development within the intact unanesthetized brain. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), kainic acid, bicuculline, picrotoxin, 4-aminopyridine, and pilocarpine were tested for their ability to induce behavioral seizures in freely swimming tadpoles when bath applied. All six chemoconvulsants consistently induced similar patterns of abnormal behavior in a dose-dependent manner, characterized by convulsive clonus-like motor patterns with periods of behavioral arrest. Extracellular field recordings demonstrated rhythmic synchronous epileptiform electrographic responses induced by convulsants irrespective of mechanism of action, that could be terminated by the anti-epileptic drug valproate. PTZ-induced seizures were further characterized using in vivo two-photon fluorescence imaging of neuronal calcium dynamics, in unanesthetized immobilized tadpoles. Imaging of calcium dynamics during PTZ-induced seizures revealed waves of neural activity propagating through large populations of neurons within the brain. Analysis of single-cell responses demonstrated distinct synchronized high-amplitude calcium spikes not observed under baseline conditions. Similar to other developmental seizure models, prolonged seizures failed to induce marked neuronal death within the brain, detected by cellular propidium iodide incorporation in vivo or TUNEL labeling. This novel developmental seizure model system has distinct advantages for controlled seizure induction, and direct visualization of both seizure activity and seizure-induced effects on individual developing neurons within the intact unanesthetized brain. Such a system is necessary to address important questions relating to the long-term impact of common perinatal seizures on developing neural circuits.},

Previous work has shown that genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 disrupts fear extinction and spatial reversal learning, suggesting that mGluR5 signaling is required for different forms of adaptive learning. Here, we tested whether ADX47273, a selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of mGluR5, can enhance adaptive learning in mice. We found that systemic administration of the ADX47273 enhanced reversal learning in the Morris Water Maze, an adaptive task. In addition, we found that ADX47273 had no effect on single-session and multi-session extinction, but administration of ADX47273 after a single retrieval trial enhanced subsequent fear extinction learning. Together these results demonstrate a role for mGluR5 signaling in adaptive learning, and suggest that mGluR5 PAMs represent a viable strategy for treatment of maladaptive learning and for improving behavioral flexibility.},

  abstract = {Rapastinel (GLYX-13) is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulator that has characteristics of a glycine site partial agonist. Rapastinel is a robust cognitive enhancer and facilitates hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in slices. In human clinical trials, rapastinel has been shown to produce marked antidepressant properties that last for at least one week following a single dose. The long-lasting antidepressant effect of a single dose of rapastinel (3 mg/kg IV) was assessed in rats using the Porsolt, open field and ultrasonic vocalization assays. Cognitive enhancement was examined using the Morris water maze, positive emotional learning, and contextual fear extinction tests. LTP was assessed in hippocampal slices. Dendritic spine morphology was measured in the dentate gyrus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Significant antidepressant-like or cognitive enhancing effects were observed that lasted for at least one week in each model. Rapastinel facilitated LTP 1 day\textendash{}2 weeks but not 4 weeks post-dosing. Biweekly dosing with rapastinel sustained this effect for at least 8 weeks. A single dose of rapastinel increased the proportion of whole-cell NMDAR current contributed by NR2B-containing NMDARs in the hippocampus 1 week post-dosing, that returned to baseline by 4 weeks post-dosing. The NMDAR antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) blocked the antidepressant-like effect of rapastinel 1 week post dosing. A single injection of rapastinel also increased mature spine density in both brain regions 24 h post-dosing. These data demonstrate that rapastinel produces its long-lasting antidepressant effects via triggering NMDAR-dependent processes that lead to increased sensitivity to LTP that persist for up to two weeks. The data also suggest that these processes led to the alterations in dendritic spine morphologies associated with the maintenance of long-term changes in synaptic plasticity associated with learning and memory.},

On average, single units and multiunits exhibited higher spike counts in response to targets relative to foils, and the size of this effect correlated with behavioral performance. Further analyses of the spike-count distributions revealed that (i) a small percentage of recorded neurons responded to any one target and (ii) a small percentage of targets elicited a strong response in any one neuron. These findings are consistent with the idea that in the human hippocampus episodic memory is supported by a sparse distributed neural code.},

  abstract = {Several cortical regions are reported to vary in meditation practitioners. However, prior analyses have focused primarily on examining gray matter or cortical thickness. Thus, additional effects with respect to other cortical features might have remained undetected. Gyrification (the pattern and degree of cortical folding) is an important cerebral characteristic related to the geometry of the brain's surface. Thus, exploring cortical gyrification in long-term meditators may provide additional clues with respect to the underlying anatomical correlates of meditation. This study examined cortical gyrification in a large sample (n\,=\,100) of meditators and controls, carefully matched for sex and age. Cortical gyrification was established by calculating mean curvature across thousands of vertices on individual cortical surface models. Pronounced group differences indicating larger gyrification in meditators were evident within the left precentral gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, right cuneus, as well as left and right anterior dorsal insula (the latter representing the global significance maximum). Positive correlations between gyrification and the number of meditation years were similarly pronounced in the right anterior dorsal insula. Although the exact functional implications of larger cortical gyrification remain to be established, these findings suggest the insula to be a key structure involved in aspects of meditation. For example, variations in insular complexity could affect the regulation of well-known distractions in the process of meditation, such as daydreaming, mind-wandering, and projections into past or future. Moreover, given that meditators are masters in introspection, awareness, and emotional control, increased insular gyrification may reflect an integration of autonomic, affective, and cognitive processes. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, further research is necessary to determine the relative contribution of nature and nurture to links between cortical gyrification and meditation.},

Present, there are several behavioural test employed to assess cognitive functions in animal models, including the frequently used novel object recognition (NOR) test. However, although atypical functional brain lateralization has been associated with neuropsychiatric conditions, spanning from schizophrenia to autism, few animal models are available to study this phenomenon in learning and memory deficits. Here we present a visual lateralization NOR model (VLNOR) in zebrafish larvae as an assay that combines brain lateralization and NOR. In zebrafish larvae, learning and memory are generally assessed by habituation, sensitization, or conditioning paradigms, which are all representatives of nondeclarative memory. The VLNOR is the first model for zebrafish larvae that studies a memory similar to the declarative memory described for mammals. We demonstrate that VLNOR can be used to study memory formation, storage, and recall of novel objects, both short and long term, in 10-day-old zebrafish. Furthermore we show that the VLNOR model can be used to study chemical modulation of memory formation and maintenance using dizocilpine (MK-801), a frequently used non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor, used to test putative antipsychotics in animal models.},

Tetanization resulted in LTP of the EPSPs elicited in both the tetanized thalamic pathway and the untetanized cortical pathway to LA. This LTP was NMDA-dependent and associated with a decrease in paired-pulse facilitation in both pathways. In LA excitatory cells, LTP of interneurons resulted in an increase in the amplitude of GABAergic IPSPs in both input pathways. Finally, isolated GABAergic IPSPs between inhibitory and excitatory neurons could be potentiated as well. Plasticity of inhibitory transmission within the LA may therefore contribute significantly to LA-mediated functions, such as fear conditioning.},

Compared to matched controls, MBCT participants showed increased autobiographical memory specificity, decreased overgenerality, and improved cognitive flexibility capacity and capacity to inhibit cognitive prepotent responses. Mediational analyses indicated that changes in cognitive flexibility partially mediate the impact of MBCT on overgeneral memories. Results are discussed in terms of Conway's [2005.

We applied tDCS (20 min, 1 mA) over the posterior part of the left peri-sylvian area of 19 young right-handed individuals while subjects acquired a miniature lexicon of 30 novel object names. Every subject participated in one session of anodal tDCS, one session of cathodal tDCS, and one sham session in a randomized and double-blinded design with three parallel versions of the miniature lexicon. Outcome measures were learning speed and learning success at the end of each session, and the transfer to the subjects' native language after the respective stimulation. With anodal stimulation, subjects showed faster and better associative learning as compared to sham stimulation. Mood ratings, reaction times, and response styles were comparable between stimulation conditions. Our results demonstrate that anodal tDCS is a promising technique to enhance language learning in healthy adults and may also have the potential to improve language reacquisition after stroke.},

This mutation also blocks homeostatic synaptic scaling of mEPSCs in visual cortex in vitro, without affecting LTP. In monocular cortex, thought not to be subject to competition, responses in TNF\ensuremath{\alpha} mutants are as reduced as in the binocular zone. Pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TNF\ensuremath{\alpha} in wild-type mice phenocopies the knockout.

We show that myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors suppressed excitatory synapse number in a neuronal activity- and calcineurin-dependent manner as hippocampal neurons formed synapses. In response to increased neuronal activity, calcium influx into neurons induced the activation of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylated and activated MEF2. When activated, MEF2 promoted the transcription of a set of genes, including arc and synGAP, that restrict synapse number. These findings define an activity-dependent transcriptional program that may control synapse number during development.},

The discontinuous tone duplicated the on/off pattern of the individual calls in the USV, but it lacked the characteristic frequency modulations. Well-localized neurotoxic PR lesions impaired conditioning to the USV, the discontinuous tone, and the training context. However, PR lesions had no effect on conditioning to the continuous tone. The authors suggest that the lesion effects on fear conditioning to both cues and contexts reflect the essential role of PR in binding stimulus elements together into unitary representations.},

  abstract = {Most excitatory synaptic terminals in the brain impinge on dendritic spines. We and others have recently shown that dynamic microtubules (MTs) enter spines from the dendritic shaft. However, a direct role for MTs in long-lasting spine plasticity has yet to be demonstrated and it remains unclear whether MT-spine invasions are directly influenced by synaptic activity. Lasting changes in spine morphology and synaptic strength can be triggered by activation of synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and are associated with learning and memory processes. To determine whether MTs are involved in NMDAR-dependent spine plasticity, we imaged MT dynamics and spine morphology in live mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons before and after acute activation of synaptic NMDARs. Synaptic NMDAR activation promoted MT-spine invasions and lasting increases in spine size, with invaded spines exhibiting significantly faster and more growth than non-invaded spines. Even individual MT invasions triggered rapid increases in spine size that persisted longer following NMDAR activation. Inhibition of either NMDARs or dynamic MTs blocked NMDAR-dependent spine growth. Together these results demonstrate for the first time that MT-spine invasions are positively regulated by signaling through synaptic NMDARs, and contribute to long-lasting structural changes in targeted spines.},

An in vivo model was developed in the rat to determine whether there are age-dependent differences in the effects of hypoxia on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. EEG recordings were obtained from Long Evans hooded rats deprived of oxygen at five ages: postnatal days 5 to 7, 10 to 12, 15 to 17, 25 to 27, and 50 to 60. Oxygen concentration was varied from 0, 2, 3, and 4\% between animals. EEGs were recorded in all animals before, during, and at 1 hour after exposure to the hypoxic condition and at 1 to 7 days afterward in a subset of animals. All animals were deprived of oxygen until the onset of apnea and bradycardia to 20 to 40\% of baseline heart rate values. Hypoxia resulted in isoelectric EEG significantly more frequently in the animals deprived of oxygen at postnatal days 25 to 27 and 50 to 60 than in the younger age groups. A highly significant effect was that the animals deprived at postnatal days 5 to 17 revealed a high incidence of epileptiform EEG activity during hypoxia. In contrast, the older animals exhibited only rare isolated EEG spikes before reaching an isoelectric EEG. The severity of hypoxia-induced epileptiform EEG changes was highest in the animals subjected to moderately hypoxic conditions (3\% and 4\% oxygen) at postnatal days 10 to 12. Furthermore, epileptiform changes persisted for hours to days following prolonged episodes of hypoxia in the younger animals. This study demonstrates a unique response of the immature brain to exhibit epileptiform activity during hypoxia.},

Consistent with previous studies, we identified a large network of amygdalar, hippocampal, and neocortical brain regions implicated in fear memory retrieval.

The extent that status epilepticus (SE), but also brief seizures, affects neuronal structure and function has been the subject of much clinical and experimental research. There is a reliance on findings from animal research because there have been few prospective clinical studies. This review suggests that the features of seizure-induced injury in the immature brain compared with the adult brain are different and that duration of seizures (SE versus brief), number of seizures, cause of seizures, presence of pre-existing abnormalities, and genetics affect the injury. Increased awareness of age-specific injuries from seizure has promoted research to determine the circumstances under which seizures may produce permanent detrimental effects. Together with recent advances in functional neuroimaging, genomic investigation, and prospective human data, these studies are likely to substantially increase our knowledge of seizure-induced injury, leading to the development of improved algorithms for prevention and treatment of epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Enlargement of dendritic spines and synapses correlates with enhanced synaptic strength during long-term potentiation (LTP), especially in immature hippocampal neurons. Less clear is the nature of this structural synaptic plasticity on mature hippocampal neurons, and nothing is known about the structural plasticity of inhibitory synapses during LTP. Here the timing and extent of structural synaptic plasticity and changes in local protein synthesis evidenced by polyribosomes were systematically evaluated at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses on CA1 dendrites from mature rats following induction of LTP with theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Recent work suggests dendritic segments can act as functional units of plasticity. To test whether structural synaptic plasticity is similarly coordinated, we reconstructed from serial section transmission electron microscopy all of the spines and synapses along representative dendritic segments receiving control stimulation or TBS-LTP. At 5 min after TBS, polyribosomes were elevated in large spines suggesting an initial burst of local protein synthesis, and by 2 h only those spines with further enlarged synapses contained polyribosomes. Rapid induction of synaptogenesis was evidenced by an elevation in asymmetric shaft synapses and stubby spines at 5 min and more nonsynaptic filopodia at 30 min. By 2 h, the smallest synaptic spines were markedly reduced in number. This synapse loss was perfectly counterbalanced by enlargement of the remaining excitatory synapses such that the summed synaptic surface area per length of dendritic segment was constant across time and conditions. Remarkably, the inhibitory synapses showed a parallel synaptic plasticity, also demonstrating a decrease in number perfectly counterbalanced by an increase in synaptic surface area. Thus, TBS-LTP triggered spinogenesis followed by loss of small excitatory and inhibitory synapses and a subsequent enlargement of the remaining synapses by 2 h. These data suggest that dendritic segments coordinate structural plasticity across multiple synapses and maintain a homeostatic balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs through local protein-synthesis and selective capture or redistribution of dendritic resources.},

  abstract = {Without a functioning dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, humans are stimulus bound and have little confidence in their ability to interact with the environment. Deficits in inhibitory control of external and internal processes coupled with impaired temporal coding of stimuli and detection capacity for novel events leave the patient functioning in a noisy internal environment without critical spatiotemporal cues. Some of these proposals are similar to those of Nauta (104). Based on connectivity of the prefrontal cortex, Nauta suggested that this region was ideally suited to generate and evaluate internal models of action. It is proposed that, in addition to this generation function, the prefrontal cortex is crucial for detecting changes in the external environment and for discriminating internally and externally derived models of the world. This chapter has described a cascade of deficits that result from damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Awareness of the sensory world, and of the apparent stream of internal and external events, is impaired by deficits in novelty detection. Changes in the world, internal or external, may not be noticed in a noisy internal milieu. These deficits contribute to impaired reality monitoring and to a subsequent lack of confidence in behavior. An inability to bridge temporal gaps and temporally sequence internal events, together with deficits in inhibitory control systems, contribute to an impairment in the ability to generate coherent representations of alternate or counterfactual realities.},

We found that learning-induced plasticity of local parvalbumin (PV) basket cells was specifically required for long-term, but not short/intermediate-term, memory consolidation in mice. PV plasticity, which involves changes in PV and GAD67 expression and connectivity onto PV neurons, was regulated by cAMP signaling in PV neurons. Following induction, PV plasticity depended on local D1/5 dopamine receptor signaling at 0\textendash{}5 h to regulate its magnitude, and at 12\textendash{}14 h for its continuance, ensuring memory consolidation. D1/5 dopamine receptor activation selectively induced DARPP-32 and ERK phosphorylation in PV neurons. At 12\textendash{}14 h, PV plasticity was required for enhanced sharp-wave ripple densities and c-Fos expression in pyramidal neurons. Our results reveal general network mechanisms of long-term memory consolidation that requires plasticity of PV basket cells induced after acquisition and sustained subsequently through D1/5 receptor signaling.},

  abstract = {The appeal of in vivo cellular imaging to any neuroscientist is not hard to understand: it is almost impossible to isolate individual neurons while keeping them and their complex interactions with surrounding tissue intact. These interactions lead to the complex network dynamics that underlie neural computation which, in turn, forms the basis of cognition, perception and consciousness. In vivo imaging allows the study of both form and function in reasonably intact preparations, often with subcellular spatial resolution, a time resolution of milliseconds and a purview of months. Recently, the limits of what can be achieved in vivo have been pushed into terrain that was previously only accessible in vitro, due to advances in both physical-imaging technology and the design of molecular contrast agents.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of oxidative damage to mitochondria, protein, and nucleic acid in the brain may lead to neuronal and cognitive dysfunction. The effects on cognitive function, brain mitochondrial structure, and biomarkers of oxidative damage were studied after feeding old rats two mitochondrial metabolites, acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR) [0.5\% or 0.2\% (wt/vol) in drinking water], and/or R-alpha-lipoic acid (LA) [0.2\% or 0.1\% (wt/wt) in diet]. Spatial memory was assessed by using the Morris water maze; temporal memory was tested by using the peak procedure (a time-discrimination procedure). Dietary supplementation with ALCAR and/or LA improved memory, the combination being the most effective for two different tests of spatial memory (P \ensuremath{<} 0.05; P \ensuremath{<} 0.01) and for temporal memory (P \ensuremath{<} 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that oxidative damage to nucleic acids (8-hydroxyguanosine and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) increased with age in the hippocampus, a region important for memory. Oxidative damage to nucleic acids occurred predominantly in RNA. Dietary administration of ALCAR and/or LA significantly reduced the extent of oxidized RNA, the combination being the most effective. Electron microscopic studies in the hippocampus showed that ALCAR and/or LA reversed age-associated mitochondrial structural decay. These results suggest that feeding ALCAR and LA to old rats improves performance on memory tasks by lowering oxidative damage and improving mitochondrial function.},

  abstract = {The polyamines are essential for cellular growth and differentiation. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which catalyses the first step in the biosynthesis of the polyamines, has a very fast turnover and is subject to a strong feedback control by the polyamines. In the present study, we show that overexpression of a metabolically stable ODC in CHO cells induced a massive cell death unless the cells were grown in the presence of the ODC inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). Cells overexpressing wild-type (unstable) ODC, on the other hand, were not dependent on the presence of DFMO for their growth. The induction of cell death was correlated with a dramatic increase in cellular putrescine levels. Analysis using flow cytometry revealed perturbed cell cycle kinetics, with a large accumulation of cells with sub-G1 amounts of DNA, which is a typical sign of apoptosis. Another strong indication of apoptosis was the finding that one of the key enzymes in the apoptotic process, caspase-3, was induced when DFMO was omitted from the growth medium. Furthermore, inhibition of the caspase activity significantly reduced the recruitment of cells to the sub-G1 fraction. In conclusion, deregulation of polyamine homeostasis may negatively affect cell proliferation and eventually lead to cell death by apoptosis if putrescine levels become too high.},

Recent evidence showed that the extent of practice-dependent plasticity in the motor cortex can be purposefully enhanced by experimental manipulation. One way of improving motor learning is to transiently increase the excitability of the motor cortex during motor learning. This can be achieved by weakening the excitability of intracortical inhibitory circuits concurrently with practice. This principle is being referred to as "gating." Another strategy to boost learning is to decrease the threshold for induction of synaptic plasticity by lowering neuronal activity in the motor cortex before practice. This approach invokes homeostatic metaplasticity. Here we highlight how transcranial brain stimulation can exploit gating and homeostatic metaplasticity to enhance motor learning in healthy subjects and in patients after stroke.},

  abstract = {Synaptic circuitry in the rat lateral amygdala (AL) was studied in brain slices using electrophysiological recordings. Electrical stimulation of external and internal capsules evoked an EPSC followed by a sequence of GABAA and GABABreceptor-mediated IPSC in principal neurons. Paired stimulation of either afferents resulted in a significant reduction (\ensuremath{\sim}45\%) of the second GABAA receptor-mediated IPSC. A priming stimulation, consisting of a priming pulse to one pathway followed by a pulse to the other pathway, resulted in a strong depression of the second IPSC basically identical to that during paired stimulation. Paired- and primed-pulse depressions were largely relieved by 10 \ensuremath{\mu}m CGP 55845A, indicating regulation through presynaptic GABAB receptors. Furthermore, putative interneurons responded with EPSCs of constant latencies to minimal stimulation of both cortical and thalamic fibers, indicating convergent monosynaptic input. At higher stimulation strength, an \ensuremath{\sim}15\% reduction of EPSCs occurred in interneurons after paired and primed stimulation, which was not sensitive to CGP 55845A. These findings indicate that a rather homogeneous population of interneurons exists in the AL with respect to their afferent connectivity, in that they receive convergent input through putative thalamic and cortical fibers, both directly and indirectly (through principal neurons), and mediate inhibitory control of postsynaptic principal neurons. This symmetrically built GABAergic circuitry can be of functional significance, given the distinctive role of the two afferent input systems for the mediation of different components of fear responses and the importance of GABAergic mechanisms for limitation of excessive neuronal activity.},

The hippocampus is also a seizure-prone region and recent studies have revealed that brief seizure episodes produce remarkably long-lasting changes which are reminiscent of `classical' LTP3. A brief seizure episode also sets in motion a cascade of events that includes changes in gene expression, sprouting of fibres and the establishment of new synaptic contacts.

  abstract = {Experience with drugs of abuse (such as cocaine) produces powerful, long-lasting memories that may be important in the development and persistence of drug addiction. The neural mechanisms that mediate how and where these cocaine memories are encoded, consolidated and stored are unknown. Here we used conditioned place preference in mice to examine the precise neural circuits that support the memory of a cocaine-cue association (the "cocaine memory trace" or "cocaine engram"). We found that a small population of neurons (\ensuremath{\sim}10\%) in the lateral nucleus of amygdala (LA) were recruited at the time of cocaine-conditioning to become part of this cocaine engram. Neurons with increased levels of the transcription factor CREB were preferentially recruited or allocated to the cocaine engram. Ablating or silencing neurons overexpressing CREB (but not a similar number of random LA neurons) before testing disrupted the expression of a previously acquired cocaine memory, suggesting that neurons overexpressing CREB become a critical hub in what is likely a larger cocaine memory engram. Consistent with theories that coordinated postencoding reactivation of neurons within an engram or cell assembly is crucial for memory consolidation (Marr, 1971; Buzs{\'a}ki, 1989; Wilson and McNaughton, 1994; McClelland et al., 1995; Girardeau et al., 2009; Dupret et al., 2010; Carr et al., 2011), we also found that post-training suppression, or nondiscriminate activation, of CREB overexpressing neurons impaired consolidation of the cocaine memory. These findings reveal mechanisms underlying how and where drug memories are encoded and stored in the brain and may also inform the development of treatments for drug addiction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND

Febrile seizures occurring in a child older than one month during an episode of fever affect 2\% to 4\% of children in Great Britain and the United States and recur in 30\%. Rapid-acting antiepileptics and antipyretics given during subsequent fever episodes have been used to avoid the adverse effects of continuous antiepileptic drugs.

OBJECTIVES

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antiepileptic and antipyretic drugs used prophylactically to treat children with febrile seizures.

SEARCH METHODS

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011. Issue 3); MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011); EMBASE (1966 to May 2011); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) (May 2011). No language restrictions were imposed. We also contacted researchers in the field to identify continuing or unpublished studies.

SELECTION CRITERIA

Trials using randomised or quasi-randomised patient allocation that compared the use of antiepileptic or antipyretic agents with each other, placebo or no treatment.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

Two review authors (RN and MO) independently applied pre-defined criteria to select trials for inclusion and extracted the pre-defined relevant data, recording methods for randomisation, blinding and exclusions. Outcomes assessed were seizure recurrence at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 months and at age 5 to 6 years in the intervention and non-intervention groups, and adverse medication effects. The presence of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.

MAIN RESULTS

Thirty-six articles describing 26 randomised trials with 2740 randomised participants were included. Thirteen interventions of continuous or intermittent prophylaxis and their control treatments were analysed. Methodological quality was moderate to poor in most studies. We could not do a meta-analysis for eight of the 13 comparisons due to insufficient numbers of trials. No significant benefit for valproate, pyridoxine, intermittent phenobarbitone or ibuprofen versus placebo or no treatment was found; nor for diclofenac versus placebo followed by ibuprofen, acetominophen or placebo; nor for intermittent rectal diazepam versus intermittent valproate, nor phenobarbitone versus intermittent rectal diazepam.There was a significant reduction of recurrent febrile seizures with intermittent oral diazepam versus placebo with a relative risk (RR) of ~0.67 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.94) at 24 months), RR of 0.61 (95\% CI 0.15 to 0.89) at 48 months, with no benefit at 6, 12 or 72 months. Phenobarbitone versus placebo or no treatment reduced seizures at 6, 12 and 24 months but not at 18 or 72 month follow up (RR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.42 to 0.84 at 6 months; RR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.46 to 0.75 at 12 months; and RR 0.65, 95\% CI 0.49 to 0.88 at 24 months). Intermittent rectal diazepam versus no treatment or placebo also reduced seizures (RR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.41 to 0.86 at 6 months; RR 0.65, 95\% CI 0.49 to 0.87 at 12 months; RR 0.2, 95\% CI 0.1 to 0.39 at 18 months; RR 0.36, 95\% CI 0.18 to 0.71 at 36 months), with no benefit at 24 months. Intermittent clobazam compared to placebo at 6 months resulted in a RR of 0.09 (95\% CI 0.02 to 0.30), an effect found against an extremely high (83.3\%) recurrence rate in the controls and which is a result that needs replication.The recording of adverse effects was variable. Lower comprehension scores in phenobarbitone treated children were found in two studies. In general, adverse effects were recorded in up to some 30\% of children in the phenobarbitone treated group and in up to 36\% in benzodiazepine treated groups. Evidence of publication bias was found in the meta analyses of comparisons for phenobarbitone versus placebo (8 studies) at 12 months but not at 6 months (6 studies); and valproate versus placebo (4 studies) at 12 months; with too few studies to identify publication bias for the other comparisons.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS

No clinically important benefits for children with febrile seizures were found for intermittent oral diazepam, phenytoin, phenobarbitone, intermittent rectal diazepam, valproate, pyridoxine, intermittent phenobarbitone or intermittent ibuprofen, nor for diclofenac versus placebo followed by ibuprofen, acetominophen or placebo.

Given the benign nature of recurrent febrile seizures, and the high prevalence of adverse effects of these drugs, parents and families should be supported with adequate contact details of medical services and information on recurrence, first aid management and, most importantly, the benign nature of the phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The chromosomal DNA of all cells is under helical tension or supercoiling. There are two classes of DNA supercoiling: plectonemic and toroidal. Plectonemic supercoiling is generated by the action of DNA topoisomerases, while toroidal supercoiling is generated by DNA-protein interactions and by topoisomerase activitities. DNA supercoiling plays an important role in replication, repair, recombination, transposition and transcription. DNA topoisomerases type I are ATP-independent enzymes that cut one DNA strand and relax supercoiled molecules. DNA topoisomerases type II requiere ATP, cut both DNA strands and supercoil relaxed molecules. All organisms have more than one topoisomerase of each, type I and type II. Escherichia coli has two topoisomerases type I: topoisomerase I and topoisomerase III and two topoisomerases type II: topoisomerase II or gyrase and topoisomerase IV. In this review we discuss the concept of DNA supercoiling and present current knowledge on E. coli DNA topoisomerases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mindfulness meditation (MM) practices constitute an important group of meditative practices that have received growing attention. The aim of the present paper was to systematically review current evidence on the neurobiological changes and clinical benefits related to MM practice in psychiatric disorders, in physical illnesses and in healthy subjects.
METHOD: A literature search was undertaken using Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane collaboration database and references of retrieved articles. Controlled and cross-sectional studies with controls published in English up to November 2008 were included.
RESULTS: Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have revealed a significant increase in alpha and theta activity during meditation. Neuroimaging studies showed that MM practice activates the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and that long-term meditation practice is associated with an enhancement of cerebral areas related to attention. From a clinical viewpoint, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has shown efficacy for many psychiatric and physical conditions and also for healthy subjects, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is mainly efficacious in reducing relapses of depression in patients with three or more episodes, Zen meditation significantly reduces blood pressure and Vipassana meditation shows efficacy in reducing alcohol and substance abuse in prisoners. However, given the low-quality designs of current studies it is difficult to establish whether clinical outcomes are due to specific or non-specific effects of MM.
DISCUSSION: Despite encouraging findings, several limitations affect current studies. Suggestions are given for future research based on better designed methodology and for future directions of investigation.},

In hippocampus, SST expression and release is regulated by seizures, and SST-containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are sensitive to seizure-induced death. In vivo and in vitro studies suggest that the loss of SST function in the dentate could contribute to epileptogenesis and seizure susceptibility. SST also has inhibitory actions in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampus indicating this peptide is an important homeostatic regulator throughout the hippocampus. In vivo studies show SST has robust antiepileptic properties with the major site of action being hippocampus. In rodents, somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SST(2)) and SST(4) appear to mediate the majority of the antiepileptic actions of SST, with SST(2) predominate in rat and SST(4) in mouse. Thus SST receptors may be appropriate targets for new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), although validation in human tissue is lacking.},

The aim of our study was to explore the neural correlates of resting state by providing behavioral and neuroimaging data from healthy volunteers. With no a priori assumptions, we first determined behaviorally the relationship between external and internal awareness in 31 subjects. We found a significant anticorrelation between external and internal awareness with a mean switching frequency of 0.05 Hz (range: 0.01\textendash{}0.1 Hz). Interestingly, this frequency is similar to BOLD fMRI slow oscillations. We then evaluated 22 healthy volunteers in an fMRI paradigm looking for brain areas where BOLD activity correlated with ``internal'' and ``external'' scores. Activation of precuneus/posterior cingulate, anterior cingulate/mesiofrontal cortices, and parahippocampal areas (``intrinsic system'') was linearly linked to intensity of internal awareness, whereas activation of lateral fronto-parietal cortices (``extrinsic system'') was linearly associated with intensity of external awareness.},

This memory-promoting effect caused by novelty depends on activation of dopamine D1/D5 receptors and requires newly synthesized proteins in the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, our results indicate the existence of a behavioral tagging process in which the exploration to a novel environment provides the plasticity-related proteins to stabilize the inhibitory avoidance memory trace.},

Here we show that astrocytes contribute to the fast dynamics of neural circuits that underlie normal cognitive behaviors. In particular, we found that the selective expression of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) in astrocytes significantly reduced the duration of carbachol-induced gamma oscillations in hippocampal slices. These data prompted us to develop a novel transgenic mouse model, specifically with inducible tetanus toxin expression in astrocytes. In this in vivo model, we found evidence of a marked decrease in electroencephalographic (EEG) power in the gamma frequency range in awake-behaving mice, whereas neuronal synaptic activity remained intact. The reduction in cortical gamma oscillations was accompanied by impaired behavioral performance in the novel object recognition test, whereas other forms of memory, including working memory and fear conditioning, remained unchanged. These results support a key role for gamma oscillations in recognition memory. Both EEG alterations and behavioral deficits in novel object recognition were reversed by suppression of tetanus toxin expression. These data reveal an unexpected role for astrocytes as essential contributors to information processing and cognitive behavior.},

However, effects across studies appear to be variable, and a systematic meta-analytic review was undertaken. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomized controlled trials or quasi-experiments without randomization, have a treatment, and have either a treated group or an untreated control group. Twenty-three studies with 30 group comparisons met the criteria for inclusion. The studies included involved clinical samples and samples of typically developing children and adults. Meta-analyses indicated that the programs produced reliable short-term improvements in working memory skills. For verbal working memory, these near-transfer effects were not sustained at follow-up, whereas for visuospatial working memory, limited evidence suggested that such effects might be maintained. More importantly, there was no convincing evidence of the generalization of working memory training to other skills (nonverbal and verbal ability, inhibitory processes in attention, word decoding, and arithmetic). The authors conclude that memory training programs appear to produce short-term, specific training effects that do not generalize. Possible limitations of the review (including age differences in the samples and the variety of different clinical conditions included) are noted. However, current findings cast doubt on both the clinical relevance of working memory training programs and their utility as methods of enhancing cognitive functioning in typically developing children and healthy adults.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus, a brain area critical for learning and memory, is especially vulnerable to damage at early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence has indicated that altered neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus represents an early critical event in the course of AD. Although causal links have not been established, a variety of key molecules involved in AD pathogenesis have been shown to impact new neuron generation, either positively or negatively. From a functional point of view, hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in structural plasticity and network maintenance. Therefore, dysfunctional neurogenesis resulting from early subtle disease manifestations may in turn exacerbate neuronal vulnerability to AD and contribute to memory impairment, whereas enhanced neurogenesis may be a compensatory response and represent an endogenous brain repair mechanism. Here we review recent findings on alterations of neurogenesis associated with pathogenesis of AD, and we discuss the potential of neurogenesis-based diagnostics and therapeutic strategies for AD.},

  abstract = {Impaired olfaction has been described as an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Neuroanatomical changes underlying this deficit in the olfactory system are largely unknown. Interestingly, neuropathology begins in the transentorhinal cortex and extends to the neighboring limbic system and basal telencephalic structures that mediate olfactory processing, including the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory bulb. The human piriform cortex has been described as a crucial area in odor quality coding; disruption of this region mediates early olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Most neuropathological investigations have focused on the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, whereas the piriform cortex has largely been neglected. This work aims to characterize the expression of the neuropathological amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} peptide, tau protein and interneuron population markers (calretinin, parvalbumin and somatostatin) in the piriform cortex of ten Alzheimer-diagnosed (80.4~\ensuremath{\pm}~8.3~years old) and five control (69.6~\ensuremath{\pm}~11.1) cases. Here, we examined the distribution of different interneuronal markers as well as co-localization of interneurons and pathological markers. Results indicated preferential vulnerability of somatostatin- (p~=~0.0001~\ensuremath{<}~\ensuremath{\alpha}~=~0.05) and calretinin-positive (p~=~0.013~\ensuremath{<}~\ensuremath{\alpha}~=~0.05) cells that colocalized with amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} peptide, while the prevalence of parvalbumin-positive cells was increased (p~=~0.045~\ensuremath{<}~\ensuremath{\alpha}~=~0.05) in the Alzheimer's cases. These data may help to reveal the neural basis of olfactory deficits linked to Alzheimer's disease as well as to characterize neuronal populations preferentially vulnerable to neuropathology in regions critically involved in early stages of the disease.},

Recent technical advancements include better preservation of tissue resulting in prolonged ability to microinject, and algorithmic improvements that compensate for the residual Z-smear inherent in all optical imaging. Confocal imaging parameters were probed systematically for the identification of both optimal resolution as well as highest efficiency. When combined, our methods yield size and density measurements comparable to serial section transmission electron microscopy in a fraction of the time. An experiment containing 3 experimental groups with 8 subjects in each can take as little as one month if optimized for speed, or approximately 4 to 5 months if the highest resolution and morphometric detail is sought.},

In the short term, stimulation evokes an array of biochemical and biophysical events that represent the execution of the neurophysiological phenotype of a particular cell. These processes, which contribute to the overall behavior of a neural circuit, do not require de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, stimulation is also linked to long-term phenotypic changes that require alterations in gene expression. Thus, one or more mechanisms must exist that couple cell-surface stimuli to the transcriptional regulatory apparatus of the neuron.

Rectal temperature rose, but did not exceed 40.0 C.After perfusion-fixation of the brain, light microscopy revealed neurons with ischemic cell change in seven animals who had had seizures lasting three hours 25 minutes to seven hours 30 minutes. These changes predominated in the neocortex (small pyramidal neurons), thalamus (anterior, dorsomedial, and ventral nuclei), and hippocampus (Sommer sector and endfolium).Comparison with our previous studies in nonparalyzed baboons indicates that paralysis provides partial protection against neuronal damage in the neocortex and hippocampus.

In our work, we found that a form of mindfulness meditation, integrative body\textendash{}mind training (IBMT), improved FA in areas surrounding the anterior cingulate cortex after 4-wk training more than controls given relaxation training. Reductions in radial diffusivity (RD) have been interpreted as improved myelin but reductions in axial diffusivity (AD) involve other mechanisms, such as axonal density. We now report that after 4-wk training with IBMT, both RD and AD decrease accompanied by increased FA, indicating improved efficiency of white matter involves increased myelin as well as other axonal changes. However, 2-wk IBMT reduced AD, but not RD or FA, and improved moods. Our results demonstrate the time-course of white matter neuroplasticity in short-term meditation. This dynamic pattern of white matter change involving the anterior cingulate cortex, a part of the brain network related to self-regulation, could provide a means for intervention to improve or prevent mental disorders.},

  abstract = {We have taken a genetic-based fate-mapping approach to determine the specific contributions of telencephalic progenitors to the structures that comprise the amygdalar fear circuit including the central (CA), lateral (LA), and basolateral (BLA) amygdala. Our data indicate that progenitors in the ventral pallium (VP) contribute projection neurons to the LA and BLA but not the CA. Rather, the CA appears to derive, at least in part, from progenitors located in the ventral lateral ganglionic eminence (vLGE). Diverse groups of interneurons populate these amygdalar nuclei, and as predicted our data support the notion that they originate from subpallial progenitors. A rather specific population of amygdalar interneurons, the intercalated cells (ITCs), is known to play a fundamental role in fear-related behaviors. However, no information on their specific origin has, as yet, been provided. Our findings suggest that the ITCs arise from the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence (dLGE) and migrate in the lateral migratory stream to populate the paracapsular regions as well as the main intercalated mass of the amygdala (IA). Germ-line Gsx2 mutants are known to exhibit an expansion of the VP into the LGE and a concomitant reduction in the dLGE and vLGE. Accordingly, Gsx2 conditional mutants display a significantly enlarged LA and a significant reduction in ITCs both within the paracapsular regions and the IA. Additional support for a dLGE origin of the ITCs was obtained in conditional mutants of the dLGE gene Sp8. Thus, our findings indicate diverse origins for the neuronal components that comprise the amygdalar fear circuit.},

These recent advances have considerable translational significance as congruent findings from studies of fear learning in animals and humans indicate that anxiety disorders result from abnormalities in the mechanisms that normally regulate conditioned fear. Due to the introduction of new techniques and the continued use of traditional approaches, it is becoming clear that conditioned fear involves much more complex networks than initially believed, including coordinated interactions between multiple excitatory and inhibitory circuits within the amygdala.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms for pattern completion and pattern separation are described in the context of a theory of hippocampal function in which the hippocampal CA3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial, associations between any spatial location (place in rodents, or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward, and to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The factors important in the pattern completion in CA3 and also a large number of independent memories stored in CA3 include: a sparse distributed representation, representations that are independent due to the randomizing effect of the mossy fibres, heterosynaptic long-term depression as well as long-term potentiation in the recurrent collateral synapses, and diluted connectivity to minimize the number of multiple synapses between any pair of CA3 neurons which otherwise distort the basins of attraction. Recall of information from CA3 is implemented by the entorhinal cortex perforant path synapses to CA3 cells, which in acting as a pattern associator allow some pattern generalization. Pattern separation is performed in the dentate granule cells using competitive learning to convert grid-like entorhinal cortex firing to place-like fields, and in the dentate to CA3 connections that have diluted connectivity. Recall to the neocortex is achieved by a reverse hierarchical series of pattern association networks implemented by the hippocampo-cortical backprojections, each one of which performs some pattern generalization, to retrieve a complete pattern of cortical firing in higher-order cortical areas. New results on competitive networks show which factors contribute to their ability to perform pattern separation, pattern clustering, and pattern categorisation, and how these apply in different hippocampal and neocortical systems.},

Physiological evidence shows a reduction with Meditation of stress-related autonomic and endocrine measures, while neuroimaging studies demonstrate the functional up-regulation of brain regions of affect regulation and attention control. Clinical studies show some evidence for the effectiveness of Meditation in disorders of affect, anxiety and attention. The combined evidence from neurobiological and clinical studies seems promising. However, a more thorough understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of action and clinical effectiveness of the different Meditative practices is needed before Meditative practices can be leveraged in the prevention and intervention of mental illness.},

  abstract = {The valence of memories is malleable because of their intrinsic reconstructive property. This property of memory has been used clinically to treat maladaptive behaviours. However, the neuronal mechanisms and brain circuits that enable the switching of the valence of memories remain largely unknown. Here we investigated these mechanisms by applying the recently developed memory engram cell- manipulation technique. We labelled with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) a population of cells in either the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus or the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) that were specifically activated during contextual fear or reward conditioning. Both groups of fear-conditioned mice displayed aversive light-dependent responses in an optogenetic place avoidance test, whereas both DG- and BLA-labelled mice that underwent reward conditioning exhibited an appetitive response in an optogenetic place preference test. Next, in an attempt to reverse the valence of memory within a subject, mice whose DG or BLA engram had initially been labelled by contextual fear or reward conditioning were subjected to a second conditioning of the opposite valence while their original DG or BLA engram was reactivated by blue light. Subsequent optogenetic place avoidance and preference tests revealed that although the DG-engram group displayed a response indicating a switch of the memory valence, the BLA-engram group did not. This switch was also evident at the cellular level by a change in functional connectivity between DG engram-bearing cells and BLA engram-bearing cells. Thus, we found that in the DG, the neurons carrying the memory engram of a given neutral context have plasticity such that the valence of a conditioned response evoked by their reactivation can be reversed by re-associating this contextual memory engram with a new unconditioned stimulus of an opposite valence. Our present work provides new insight into the functional neural circuits underlying the malleability of emotional memory.},

A total of 49 patients with AD and 52 healthy elderly controls were administered neuropsychological tests as well as the Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS) test, an observation-based test of activities of daily living (ADLs). In this project, we assessed 14 separate tasks assessed by the DAFS. To analyze the data, 4 cognitive domains were created using neuropsychological composite z scores (means and standard deviation obtained from control data) for patients with AD. Results revealed that patients with AD performed worse on the memory, language, and visual-spatial relative to the executive domain. Additionally, patients with AD performed poorer than the controls on nearly all 14 DAFS tasks, with their worse performance being on the shopping-related tasks which, in part, requires memory skills. Logistic regression revealed better specificity than sensitivity classifications based on the DAFS tasks, and stepwise regression analyses indicated that cognitive domains predicted specific aspects of functional abilities. These findings suggest that patients with AD display a distinct pattern of ADLs performance, that traditional neuropsychological tests are useful in predicting daily functioning, and the DAFS has some strengths and weaknesses in classifying AD and controls.},

  abstract = {Although much has been learned about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying Pavlovian fear conditioning at the systems and cellular levels, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying fear memory consolidation. The present experiments evaluated the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling cascade in the amygdala during Pavlovian fear conditioning. We first show that ERK/MAPK is transiently activated-phosphorylated in the amygdala, specifically the lateral nucleus (LA), at 60 min, but not 15, 30, or 180 min, after conditioning, and that this activation is attributable to paired presentations of tone and shock rather than to nonassociative auditory stimulation, foot shock sensitization, or unpaired tone-shock presentations. We next show that infusions of U0126, an inhibitor of ERK/MAPK activation, aimed at the LA, dose-dependently impair long-term memory of Pavlovian fear conditioning but leaves short-term memory intact. Finally, we show that bath application of U0126 impairs long-term potentiation in the LA in vitro. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ERK/MAPK activation is necessary for both memory consolidation of Pavlovian fear conditioning and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala.},

In this task subjects learned which of two outcomes would occur on each trial after presentation of a particular combination of cues. Ten minutes of anodal, but not cathodal, stimulation improved implicit learning only when the left PFC was stimulated. Our results show that implicit PLC can be modified by weak anodal tDCS, which probably increases neural excitability, as has been shown in the motor and visual cortices previously.

Newly developed genetic, pharmacological, and optical tools allow activation of neurons with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution; however, the inaccessibility to light of widely-distributed neuronal populations and the invasiveness required for activation by light or infused ligands limit the utility of these methods. To overcome these barriers, we created transgenic mice expressing an evolved G protein-coupled receptor (hM3Dq) selectively activated by the pharmacologically inert, orally bioavailable drug clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Here, we expressed hM3Dq in forebrain principal neurons. Local field potential and single neuron recordings revealed that peripheral administration of CNO activated hippocampal neurons selectively in hM3Dq-expressing mice. Behavioral correlates of neuronal activation included increased locomotion, stereotypy, and limbic seizures. These results demonstrate a novel and powerful chemical-genetic tool for remotely controlling the activity of discrete populations of neurons in vivo.},

Hippocampal volume correlated with the amount of time spent as a taxi driver (positively in the posterior and negatively in the anterior hippocampus). These data are in accordance with the idea that the posterior hippocampus stores a spatial representation of the environment and can expand regionally to accommodate elaboration of this representation in people with a high dependence on navigational skills.

  volume = {79},

  abstract = {We have previously shown that hypoxia induces both acute and chronic epileptogenic effects that are age dependent. Global hypoxia (3-4\% O2) induces seizure activity in the developing brain [postnatal day (P)10-12] but not at younger or older ages. Adult rats with prior seizures induced by hypoxia at P10 show increased seizure susceptibility to chemical convulsants compared with controls. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that acute and chronic epileptogenic effects of hypoxia are demonstrable in hippocampus both in vivo and in vitro. Depth electrode recordings confirmed the presence of ictal activity within hippocampus in P10 rats during global hypoxia. Hippocampal slices prepared from P10 pups killed at 10 min after recovery from hypoxia showed evidence of increased excitability. Extracellular field recordings revealed that the amplitude and duration of long-term potentiation (LTP) was increased significantly in area CA1 of hippocampal slices removed from hypoxic pups. In addition, extracellular recordings within areas CA1 and CA3 showed significantly longer afterdischarge durations in response to kindling stimuli in slices from hypoxic pups compared with controls. To evaluate whether there were also long-term changes in hippocampal excitability, hippocampal slices were prepared from adult rats that had underwent hypoxia at P10 and compared with slices from adult litter-mate controls. A Mg2+-free medium was superfused to induce epileptiform activity within the slices. Extracellular recordings from stratum pyramidale of area CA1 showed that Mg2+-free media induced significantly more frequent ictal discharges in slices from previously hypoxic rats compared with controls. These results provide evidence that the naturally occurring stimulus of hypoxia can result in both acute and chronic changes in the excitability of the CA1 neuronal network. These results parallel our previous in vivo studies demonstrating that global hypoxia acutely increases excitability in the immature brain and that hypoxia during the age window approximately P10 results in long-lasting increases in seizure susceptibility within hippocampus. Our results suggest that the age-dependent epileptogenic effects of hypoxia are in part mediated by a direct and permanent effect on neuronal excitability within hippocampal neuronal networks.},

Moreover, shifts between expression and extinction circuits involve coordinated interactions with different regions of the medial prefrontal cortex.

Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has become a popular form of intervention. However, the existing reviews report inconsistent findings.
Objective
To clarify these inconsistencies in the literature, we conducted a comprehensive effect-size analysis to evaluate the efficacy of MBT.
Data sources
A systematic review of studies published in journals or in dissertations in PubMED or PsycINFO from the first available date until May 10, 2013.
Review methods
A total of 209 studies (n = 12,145) were included.
Results
Effect-size estimates suggested that MBT is moderately effective in pre-post comparisons (n = 72; Hedge's g = .55), in comparisons with waitlist controls (n = 67; Hedge's g = .53), and when compared with other active treatments (n = 68; Hedge's g = .33), including other psychological treatments (n = 35; Hedge's g = .22). MBT did not differ from traditional CBT or behavioral therapies (n = 9; Hedge's g = - .07) or pharmacological treatments (n = 3; Hedge's g = .13).
Conclusion
MBT is an effective treatment for a variety of psychological problems, and is especially effective for reducing anxiety, depression, and stress.},

We developed a high-throughput method to quantify yeast sporulation efficiency and used this technique to analyze a line cross between a high-efficiency oak tree isolate and a low-efficiency wine strain. We find that natural variation in sporulation efficiency mirrors natural variation in higher eukaryotes: it shows divergence between isolated populations, arises from loci of major effect, and exhibits epistasis. We show that the lower sporulation efficiency of the wine strain results from a failure to initiate sporulation, rather than from slower kinetics of meiosis and spore formation. The two strains differentially regulate many genes involved in aerobic respiration, an essential pathway for sporulation, such that the oak tree strain appears better poised to generate energy from this pathway. We also report that a polymorphism in RME1 that affects sporulation efficiency in laboratory strains also cosegregates with significant phenotypic differences in our cross of natural isolates. These results lay the groundwork for the study of variation in sporulation efficiency among natural isolates of yeast.},

  abstract = {Cortical excitability changes induced by tDCS and revealed by TMS, are increasingly being used as an index of neuronal plasticity in the human cortex. The aim of this paper is to summarize the partially adverse effects of 567 tDCS sessions over motor and non-motor cortical areas (occipital, temporal, parietal) from the last 2 years, on work performed in our laboratories. One-hundred and two of our subjects who participated in our tDCS studies completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained rating scales regarding the presence and severity of headache, difficulties in concentrating, acute mood changes, visual perceptual changes and any discomforting sensation like pain, tingling, itching or burning under the electrodes, during and after tDCS. Participants were healthy subjects (75.5\%), migraine patients (8.8\%), post-stroke patients (5.9\%) and tinnitus patients (9.8\%). During tDCS a mild tingling sensation was the most common reported adverse effect (70.6\%), moderate fatigue was felt by 35.3\% of the subjects, whereas a light itching sensation under the stimulation electrodes occurred in 30.4\% of cases. After tDCS headache (11.8\%), nausea (2.9\%) and insomnia (0.98\%) were reported, but fairly infrequently. In addition, the incidence of the itching sensation (p = 0.02) and the intensity of tingling sensation (p = 0.02) were significantly higher during tDCS in the group of the healthy subjects, in comparison to patients; whereas the occurrence of headache was significantly higher in the patient group (p = 0.03) after the stimulation. Our results suggest that tDCS applied to motor and non-motor areas according to the present tDCS safety guidelines, is associated with relatively minor adverse effects in healthy humans and patients with varying neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {The underlying neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory have been heavily explored using associative learning paradigms. Two of the more commonly employed learning paradigms have been contextual and delay fear conditioning. In fear conditioning, a subject learns to associate a neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus; CS), such as a tone or the context of the room, with a fear provoking stimulus (unconditioned stimulus; US), such as a mild footshock. Utilizing these two paradigms, various analyses have elegantly demonstrated that the amygdala plays a role in both fear-related associative learning paradigms. However, the amygdala's involvement in trace fear conditioning, a forebrain-dependent fear associative learning paradigm that has been suggested to tap into higher cognitive processes, has not been closely investigated. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the specific amygdala nuclei involved with trace fear conditioning has not been examined. The present study used Arc expression as an activity marker to determine the amygdala's involvement in trace fear associative learning and to further explore involvement of specific amygdalar nuclei. Arc is an immediate early gene that has been shown to be associated with neuronal activation and is believed to be necessary for neuronal plasticity. Findings from the present study demonstrated that trace-conditioned mice, compared to backward-conditioned (stimulation-control), delay-conditioned and na{\"\i}ve mice, exhibited elevated amygdalar Arc expression in the basolateral (BLA) but not the central (CeA) or the lateral amygdala (LA). These findings are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that the amygdala plays a critical role in trace conditioning. Furthermore, these findings parallel studies demonstrating hippocampal-BLA activation following contextual fear conditioning, suggesting that trace fear conditioning and contextual fear conditioning may involve similar amygdala nuclei. Together, findings from this study demonstrate similarities in the pathway for trace and contextual fear conditioning, and further suggest possible underlying mechanisms for acquisition and consolidation of these two types of fear-related learning.},

  abstract = {AIMS: \ensuremath{\beta}-amyloid (A\ensuremath{\beta}) plaques are a key feature of Alzheimer's disease pathology but correlate poorly with dementia. They are associated with astrocytes which may modulate the effect of A\ensuremath{\beta}-deposition on the neuropil. This study characterised the astrocyte response to A\ensuremath{\beta} plaque subtypes, and investigated their association with cognitive impairment.
METHODS: A\ensuremath{\beta} plaque subtypes were identified in the cingulate gyrus using dual labelling immunohistochemistry to A\ensuremath{\beta} and GFAP+ astrocytes, and quantitated in two cortical areas: the area of densest plaque burden and the deep cortex near the white matter border (layer VI). Three subtypes were defined for both diffuse and compact plaques (also known as classical or core-plaques): A\ensuremath{\beta} plaque with (1) no associated astrocytes, (2) focal astrogliosis or (3) circumferential astrogliosis.
RESULTS: In the area of densest burden, diffuse plaques with no astrogliosis (\ensuremath{\beta} = -0.05, p = 0.001) and with focal astrogliosis (\ensuremath{\beta} = -0.27, p = 0.009) significantly associated with lower MMSE scores when controlling for sex and age at death. In the deep cortex (layer VI), both diffuse and compact plaques without astrogliosis associated with lower MMSE scores (\ensuremath{\beta} = -0.15, p = 0.017 and \ensuremath{\beta} = -0.81, p = 0.03, respectively). Diffuse plaques with no astrogliosis in layer VI related to dementia status (OR = 1.05, p = 0.025). In the area of densest burden, diffuse plaques with no astrogliosis or with focal astrogliosis associated with increasing Braak stage (\ensuremath{\beta} = 0.01, p\ensuremath{<}0.001 and \ensuremath{\beta} = 0.07, p\ensuremath{<}0.001, respectively), and ApoE\ensuremath{\epsilon}4 genotype (OR = 1.02, p = 0.001 and OR = 1.10, p = 0.016, respectively). In layer VI all plaque subtypes associated with Braak stage, and compact amyloid plaques with little and no associated astrogliosis associated with ApoE\ensuremath{\epsilon}4 genotype (OR = 1.50, p = 0.014 and OR = 0.10, p = 0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Reactive astrocytes in close proximity to either diffuse or compact plaques may have a neuroprotective role in the ageing brain, and possession of at least one copy of the ApoE\ensuremath{\epsilon}4 allele impacts the astroglial response to A\ensuremath{\beta} plaques.},

  abstract = {Neurons may compete against one another for integration into a memory trace. Specifically, neurons in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala with relatively higher levels of cAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein (CREB) seem to be preferentially allocated to a fear memory trace, while neurons with relatively decreased CREB function seem to be excluded from a fear memory trace. CREB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that modulates many diverse cellular processes, raising the question as to which of these CREB-mediated processes underlie memory allocation. CREB is implicated in modulating dendritic spine number and morphology. As dendritic spines are intimately involved in memory formation, we investigated whether manipulations of CREB function alter spine number or morphology of neurons at the time of fear conditioning. We used viral vectors to manipulate CREB function in the lateral amygdala (LA) principal neurons in mice maintained in their homecages. At the time that fear conditioning normally occurs, we observed that neurons with high levels of CREB had more dendritic spines, while neurons with low CREB function had relatively fewer spines compared to control neurons. These results suggest that the modulation of spine density provides a potential mechanism for preferential allocation of a subset of neurons to the memory trace.},

This form of plasticity imparts bimodal control of mossy fiber\textendash{}driven CA3 burst firing and spike temporal fidelity.

  abstract = {The molecular basis of neuronal circuit reorganization during epileptogenesis is poorly understood. Such data are, however, critical for the search of new targets for the prevention of epileptogenesis. Here, we extended our previous studies on caspases in epileptogenesis by investigating the expression and activity of caspase 6 at different phases of the epileptic process in rats. Epileptogenesis was triggered by kainate-induced status epilepticus (SE) under video-electroencephalography-monitoring. Caspase 6 activity was measured fluorometrically in the hippocampus 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks after SE. Caspase 6 expression was examined using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Our data demonstrated that the SE-induced increase in the expression of cleaved caspase 6 and its intraneuronal localization were dependent on the time delay from SE induction. Double-labeling with a neuronal marker, NeuN, indicated that within the first 48 h, caspase 6 immunoreactivity was present both in the hippocampal pyramidal cells and hilar neurons, some of which were also terminal transferase dUTP-end labeling-positive. This was coincident with a transient 18-fold increase in caspase 6 enzymatic activity. At the 1-week and 4-week time points, elevated caspase 6 immunoreactivity was detected in the dendritic processes and neuropil. These findings indicate that caspase 6 expression remains elevated long after the occurrence of acute cell death during epileptogenesis and epilepsy. Further, caspase 6 protein is not exclusively located in the somata of neurons, but also in dendrites. These data suggest that caspase 6 has functions other than execution of programmed cell death in epileptogenic hippocampus.},

  abstract = {While many studies have investigated electroencephalographic (EEG) features of dementia, few have analysed the relationship between EEG and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in cognitive impairment. Seizures are frequently observed at the end stage of Alzheimer disease, and experimental animal studies support the view that epileptiform activity may contribute to the cognitive decline. In this paper, after reviewing literature findings concerning the role of EEG in dementia, we show the preliminary results of our study aimed to correlate the presence of epileptiform EEG patterns with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in order to better define the prognosis of dementia. Our study shows a clear relationship between phospho-tau protein levels and epileptiform EEG pattern. This finding seems to suggest in humans the observation made in animal models that not only \ensuremath{\beta}-amyloid protein, but also tau and phospho-tau proteins, are involved in the aberrant regulation of neural transmission possibly contributing to EEG deterioration, cognitive decline and worse prognosis. On the basis of the relationship between phospho-tau protein, cognitive decline and epileptogenicity we suspect that high liquoral phospho-tau levels and epileptiform EEG pattern may provide an early identification of patients with dementia and/or represent an aggressive phenotype of dementia. We propose that qualitative EEG analysis integrated with cerebrospinal biomarkers may be extensively used to better define dementia.},

  abstract = {Sporulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a developmental process in which four haploid spores are created within a single mother cell. During this process, the prospore membrane is generated de novo on the spindle pole body, elongates along the nuclear envelope and engulfs the nucleus. By screening previously identified sporulation-defective mutants, we identified additional genes required for prospore membrane formation. Deletion of either ERV14, which encodes a COPII cargo receptor, or the meiotically induced SMA2 gene resulted in misshapen prospore membranes. Sma2p is a predicted integral membrane that localized to the prospore membrane in wild-type cells but was retained in the ER in erv14 cells, suggesting that the prospore membrane morphology defect of erv14 cells is due to mislocalization of Sma2p. Overexpression of the ERV14 paralog ERV15 largely suppressed the sporulation defect in erv14 cells. Although deletion of ERV15 alone had no phenotype, erv14 erv15 double mutants displayed a complete block of prospore membrane formation. Plasma membrane proteins, including the t-SNARE Sso1p, accumulated in the ER upon transfer of the double mutant cells to sporulation medium. These results reveal a developmentally regulated change in the requirements for ER export in S. cerevisiae.},

Here, using the converse behavioural states of fear extinction and its context-dependent renewal as a model in mice, we show that bi-directional transitions between states of high and low fear are triggered by a rapid switch in the balance of activity between two distinct populations of basal amygdala neurons. These two populations are integrated into discrete neuronal circuits differentially connected with the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Targeted and reversible neuronal inactivation of the basal amygdala prevents behavioural changes without affecting memory or expression of behaviour. Our findings indicate that switching between distinct behavioural states can be triggered by selective activation of specific neuronal circuits integrating sensory and contextual information. These observations provide a new framework for understanding context-dependent changes of fear behaviour.},

  abstract = {Many lines of evidence suggest that memory in the mammalian brain is stored with distinct spatiotemporal patterns(1,2). Despite recent progresses in identifying neuronal populations involved in memory coding(3-5), the synapse-level mechanism is still poorly understood. Computational models and electrophysiological data have shown that functional clustering of synapses along dendritic branches leads to nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs and greatly expands the computing power of a neural network(6-10). However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy(11), we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines. Our findings suggest that clustering of new synapses along dendrites is induced by repetitive activation of the cortical circuitry during learning, providing a structural basis for spatial coding of motor memory in the mammalian brain.},

For example, the presence of gut microbiota regulates the set point for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity.Methods We investigated basal behavior of adult germ-free (GF), Swiss Webster female mice in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and compared this to conventionally reared specific pathogen free (SPF) mice. Additionally, we measured brain mRNA expression of genes implicated in anxiety and stress-reactivity.Key Results Germ-free mice, compared to SPF mice, exhibited basal behavior in the EPM that can be interpreted as anxiolytic. Altered GF behavior was accompanied by a decrease in the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit NR2B mRNA expression in the central amygdala, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and decreased serotonin receptor 1A (5HT1A) expression in the dentate granule layer of the hippocampus.Conclusions \& Inferences We conclude that the presence or absence of conventional intestinal microbiota influences the development of behavior, and is accompanied by neurochemical changes in the brain.},

Here we have investigated the molecular basis for such functional plasticity involved in this model. Based on the role of BDNF on synaptic plasticity and neuronal growth, the focus of this study is on BDNF and its downstream effectors CREB, synapsin I, and GAP-43. In particular, we determined the effects of natural whisker use during 2, 7 or 28 days exposure to a NH on barrel cortex and hippocampus, as compared to standard cage controls. Naturalistic whisker use resulted in increased levels of mRNAs and proteins for BDNF and its downstream effectors. Level changes for these markers were already detected after 2 days in the naturalistic habitat and grew larger over longer exposures (7 and 28 days). The cerebral cortex was found to be sensitive to the naturalistic habitat exposure at all time points, and more sensitive than the hippocampus to the trimming of the whiskers. Trimming of the whiskers decreased the level of most of the markers under study, suggesting that whiskers exert a tonic influence on plasticity markers that can be further enhanced by naturalistic use. These results implicate BDNF and its downstream effectors in the plasticity induced by the naturalistic habitat. The critical action of experience on molecular substrates of plasticity seems to provide molecular basis for the design of experienced-based rehabilitative strategies to enhance brain function.},

How the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear are encoded within CEA inhibitory circuits is not understood. Using in vivo electrophysiological, optogenetic and pharmacological approaches in mice, we show that neuronal activity in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CEl) is required for fear acquisition, whereas conditioned fear responses are driven by output neurons in the medial subdivision (CEm). Functional circuit analysis revealed that inhibitory CEA microcircuits are highly organized and that cell-type-specific plasticity of phasic and tonic activity in the CEl to CEm pathway may gate fear expression and regulate fear generalization. Our results define the functional architecture of CEA microcircuits and their role in the acquisition and regulation of conditioned fear behaviour.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To examine the association between alcohol use and cognitive decline in a longitudinal study of a representative elderly community sample free of dementia at baseline.

METHODS

Cognitive functions and self-reported drinking habits were assessed at 2-year intervals over an average of 7 years of follow-up. Cognitive measures, grouped into composites, were examined in association with alcohol consumption. Trajectory analyses identified latent homogeneous groups with respect to alcohol use frequency over time, and their association with average decline over the same period in each cognitive domain. Models controlled for age, sex, education, depression, smoking, general mental status (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]), performance on the given test at baseline, and subsequent new-onset dementia during follow-up.

RESULTS

The authors found three homogeneous trajectories that they characterized as no drinking, minimal drinking, and moderate drinking. Few heavy drinkers were identified in this elderly cohort. Compared to no drinking, both minimal and moderate drinking were associated with lesser decline on the MMSE and Trailmaking tests. Minimal drinking was also associated with lesser decline on tests of learning and naming. These associations were more pronounced when comparing current drinkers to former drinkers (quitters) than to lifelong abstainers.

CONCLUSION

In a representative elderly cohort over an average of 7 years, a pattern of mild-to-moderate drinking, compared to not drinking, was associated with lesser average decline in cognitive domains over the same period.},

We report that exposure of hippocampal neurons to sub-lethal levels of A\ensuremath{\beta} decreased spine density, increased spine length and subdued spine motility. The effect of A\ensuremath{\beta} on spine density was reversible. Moreover, A\ensuremath{\beta}'s effect on dendritic spine density was blocked by rolipram, a phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of a cAMP dependent pathway.

The cumulative incidence of febrile convulsions among children ranges from about 1\% in China to more than 8\% in Japan and 14\% in Guam. The peak incidence of a first febrile convulsion occurs in the second year of life. Between 0.5\% and 1\% of children and adolescents experience a seizure associated with other acute metabolic or neurologic insults; most of these occur in the neonatal period. The incidence of epilepsy (recurrent unprovoked seizures) in children and adolescents seems relatively consistent across all populations studied, ranging from 50 to 100/100,000. The highest incidence of epilepsy is in the first year of life. West syndrome accounts for about 2\% of all childhood epilepsy. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome for 1-2\%, childhood absence epilepsy (pyknolepsy) for 10-15\%, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy for 5\%, and idiopathic localization-related epilepsy for 10\%.

It was more effective in potentiating steady-state currents (i.e., desensitized response) than the peak phase of the response, indicating that the degree of desensitization was reduced in the presence of the polyamine. Kinetic analysis revealed that the desensitization onset rate, but not recovery rate, was affected by spermine. The effect was voltage independent and was seen in thoroughly dialyzed cells, in which desensitization becomes independent of glycine. Spermine potentiation showed fast on-off kinetics, and intracellular spermine, loaded in the recording pipette, did not occlude potentiation by extracellularly applied spermine. These results are consistent with the existence of a modulatory site for polyamines in the extracellular domain of the NMDA receptor, the activation of which potentiates NMDA receptor function by regulating its desensitization kinetics.},

GLYX-13 is a tetrapeptide (Thr-Pro-Pro-Thr) which acts as a NMDAR receptor partial agonist at the glycine site. GLYX-13 was administered to young adult (3 month old) and aged (27\textendash{}32 month old) Fischer 344 X Brown Norway F1 rats (FBNF1), and behavioral learning tested in trace eyeblink conditioning (tEBC), a movable platform version of the Morris water maze (MWM), and alternating t-maze tasks. GLYX-13 (1 mg/kg i.v.) enhanced learning in both young adult and aging animals for MWM and alternating t-maze, and increased tEBC in aging rats. We previously showed optimal enhancement of tEBC in young adult rats given GLYX-13 at the same dose. Of these learning tasks, the MWM showed the most robust age related deficit in learning. In the MWM, GLYX-13 enhancement of learning was greater in the old compared to the young adult animals. Examination of the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices showed that aged rats showed marked, selective impairment in the magnitude of LTP evoked by a sub-maximal tetanus, and that GLYX-13 significantly enhanced the magnitude of LTP in slices from both young adult and aged rats without affecting LTD. These data, combined with the observation that the GLYX-13 enhancement of learning was greater in old than in young adult animals, suggest that GLYX-13 may be a promising treatment for deficits in cognitive function associated with aging.},

  abstract = {Febrile seizures (FSs) constitute the most prevalent seizure type during childhood. Whether prolonged FSs alter limbic excitability, leading to spontaneous seizures (temporal lobe epilepsy) during adulthood, has been controversial. Recent data indicate that, in the immature rat model, prolonged FSs induce transient structural changes of some hippocampal pyramidal neurons and long-term functional changes of hippocampal circuitry. However, whether these neuroanatomical and electrophysiological changes promote hippocampal excitability and lead to epilepsy has remained unknown. By using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we determined that prolonged hyperthermia-induced seizures in immature rats caused long-term enhanced susceptibility to limbic convulsants that lasted to adulthood. Thus, extensive hippocampal electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring failed to demonstrate spontaneous seizures in adult rats that had experienced hyperthermic seizures during infancy. However, 100\% of animals developed hippocampal seizures after systemic administration of a low dose of kainate, and most progressed to status epilepticus. Conversely, a minority of normothermic and hyperthermic controls had (brief) seizures, none developing status epilepticus. In vitro, spontaneous epileptiform discharges were not observed in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices derived from either control or experimental groups. However, Schaeffer collateral stimulation induced prolonged, self-sustaining, status epilepticus-like discharges exclusively in slices from experimental rats. These data indicate that hyperthermic seizures in the immature rat model of FSs do not cause spontaneous limbic seizures during adulthood. However, they reduce thresholds to chemical convulsants in vivo and electrical stimulation in vitro, indicating persistent enhancement of limbic excitability that may facilitate the development of epilepsy.},

To find out whether the olfactory information can modulate the processing of sensory information in the lateral nucleus we injected Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, an anterograde axonal tracer, into the different divisions of the periamygdaloid cortex. We found that the PAC division of the periamygdaloid cortex projects to the ventrolateral and medial divisions, but not the dorsolateral division, of the lateral amygdaloid nucleus. Therefore, the projection from the PAC to the lateral nucleus provides a route, by which the olfactory information may become associated with other sensory modalities. Also, together with our previous finding that the lateral nucleus projects to the periamygdaloid cortex, the present data demonstrate that the lateral nucleus and the PAC are reciprocally connected.},

  abstract = {While overall life expectancy has been increasing, the human brain still begins deteriorating after the first two decades of life and continues degrading further with increasing age. Thus, techniques that diminish the negative impact of aging on the brain are desirable. Existing research, although scarce, suggests meditation to be an attractive candidate in the quest for an accessible and inexpensive, efficacious remedy. Here, we examined the link between age and cerebral gray matter re-analyzing a large sample (n = 100) of long-term meditators and control subjects aged between 24 and 77 years. When correlating global and local gray matter with age, we detected negative correlations within both controls and meditators, suggesting a decline over time. However, the slopes of the regression lines were steeper and the correlation coefficients were stronger in controls than in meditators. Moreover, the age-affected brain regions were much more extended in controls than in meditators, with significant group-by-age interactions in numerous clusters throughout the brain. Altogether, these findings seem to suggest less age-related gray matter atrophy in long-term meditation practitioners.},

  abstract = {DNA gyrase introduces negative supercoils into closed-circular DNA using the free energy of ATP hydrolysis. Consideration of steric and thermodynamic aspects of the supercoiling reaction indicates that there should be a lower limit to the size of DNA circle which can be supercoiled by gyrase. We have investigated the supercoiling reaction of circles from 116-427 base pairs (bp) in size and have determined that gyrase can supercoil certain relaxed isomers of circles as small as 174 bp, dependent on the final superhelix density of the supercoiled product. Furthermore, this limiting superhelical density (-0.11) is the same as that determined for the supercoiling of plasmid pBR322. We also find that although circles in the range 116-152 bp cannot be supercoiled, they can nevertheless be relaxed by gyrase when positively supercoiled. These data suggest that the conformational changes associated with the supercoiling reaction can be carried out by gyrase in a circle as small as 116 bp. We discuss these results with respect to the thermodynamics of DNA supercoiling and steric aspects of the gyrase mechanism.},

The goals of the present study were to determine whether neurons in the AL are also responsive to somatosensory stimuli and, if so, whether single neurons in the AL respond to both auditory and somatosensory stimulation. Single-unit activity was recorded in the AL in anesthetized rats during the presentation of acoustic (clicks) and somatosensory (footshock) stimuli. Neurons in the dorsal subdivision of the AL responded to both somatosensory and auditory stimuli, whereas neurons in the ventrolateral AL responded only to somatosensory stimuli and neurons in the ventromedial AL did not respond to either stimuli. These findings indicate that the dorsal AL is a site of auditory and somatosensory convergence and may therefore be a locus of convergence of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli in auditory fear conditioning.},

Hebb's second postulate argues that activated ensembles of neurons reverberate in order to provide temporal coordination of different neural signals, and thereby facilitate coincidence detection. Recent evidence from our groups has suggested that the lateral amygdala (LA) contains recurrent microcircuits and that these may reverberate. Additionally this reverberant activity is precisely timed with latencies that would facilitate coincidence detection between cortical and sub cortical afferents to the LA. Thus, recent data at the microcircuit level in the amygdala provide some physiological evidence in support of the second Hebbian postulate.},

Here, we recorded BLA neurons during the retrieval of associative memories and used optogenetic-mediated phototagging to identify populations of neurons that synapse in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the central amygdala (CeA), or ventral hippocampus (vHPC). We found that despite heterogeneous neural responses within each population, the proportions of BLA-NAc neurons excited by reward predictive cues and of BLA-CeA neurons excited by aversion predictive cues were higher than within the entire BLA. Although the BLA-vHPC projection is known to drive behaviors of innate negative valence, these neurons did not preferentially code for learned negative valence. Together, these findings suggest that valence encoding in the BLA is at least partially mediated via divergent activity of anatomically defined neural populations.},

  abstract = {The amygdala is a key structure of the brain's reward system. Existing theories view its role in decision-making as restricted to an early valuation stage that provides input to decision mechanisms in downstream brain structures. However, the extent to which the amygdala itself codes information about economic choices is unclear. Here, we report that individual neurons in the primate amygdala predict behavioral choices in an economic decision task. We recorded the activity of amygdala neurons while monkeys chose between saving liquid reward with interest and spending the accumulated reward. In addition to known value-related responses, we found that activity in a group of amygdala neurons predicted the monkeys' upcoming save\textendash{}spend choices with an average accuracy of 78\%. This choice-predictive activity occurred early in trials, even before information about specific actions associated with save\textendash{}spend choices was available. For a substantial number of neurons, choice-differential activity was specific for free, internally generated economic choices and not observed in a control task involving forced imperative choices. A subgroup of choice-predictive neurons did not show relationships to value, movement direction, or visual stimulus features. Choice-predictive activity in some amygdala neurons was preceded by transient periods of value coding, suggesting value-to-choice transitions and resembling decision processes in other brain systems. These findings suggest that the amygdala might play an active role in economic decisions. Current views of amygdala function should be extended to incorporate a role in decision-making beyond valuation.},

  abstract = {Summary
Stimuli that possess inherently rewarding or aversive qualities elicit emotional responses and also induce learning by imparting valence upon neutral sensory cues. Evidence has accumulated implicating the amygdala as a critical structure in mediating these processes. We have developed a genetic strategy to identify the representations of rewarding and aversive unconditioned stimuli (USs) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and have examined their role in innate and learned responses. Activation of an ensemble of US-responsive cells in the BLA elicits innate physiological and behavioral responses of different valence. Activation of this US ensemble can also reinforce appetitive and aversive learning when paired with differing neutral stimuli. Moreover, we establish that the activation of US-responsive cells in the BLA is necessary for the expression of a~conditioned response. Neural representations of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli therefore ultimately connect to US-responsive cells in the BLA to elicit both innate and learned responses.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.brs.2012.09.010},
  abstract = {Background
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces long-lasting NMDA receptor-dependent cortical plasticity via persistent subthreshold polarization of neuronal membranes. Conventional bipolar tDCS is applied with two large (35~cm2) rectangular electrodes, resulting in directional modulation of neuronal excitability. Recently a newly designed 4~\texttimes{}~1 high-definition (HD) tDCS protocol was proposed for more focal stimulation according to the results of computational modeling. HD tDCS utilizes small disc electrodes deployed in 4~\texttimes{}~1 ring configuration whereby the physiological effects of the induced electric field are thought to be grossly constrained to the cortical area circumscribed by the ring.
Objective
We aim to compare the physiological effects of both tDCS electrode arrangements on motor cortex excitability.
Methods
tDCS was applied with 2~mA for 10~min. Fourteen healthy subjects participated, and motor cortex excitability was monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after tDCS.
Results
Excitability enhancement following anodal and a respective reduction after cathodal stimulation occurred in both, conventional and HD tDCS. However, the plastic changes showed a more delayed peak at 30~min and longer lasting after-effects for more than 2~h after HD tDCS for both polarities, as compared to conventional tDCS.
Conclusion
The results show that this new electrode arrangement is efficient for the induction of neuroplasticity in the primary motor cortex. The pattern of aftereffects might be compatible with the concept of GABA-mediated surround inhibition, which should be explored in future studies directly.},

However, little is known about the effects of external dopaminergic challenges on processing of uncertainty in decision-making tasks. Therefore, the present study examined changes in fMRI activation patterns in a natural sampling paradigm. Decision making under uncertainty was examined before and after administration of a single dose of 40 mg methylphenidate as an acute dopaminergic pharmacological challenge. We found that the level of uncertainty was positively correlated with activations in the prefrontal cortex. Conversely, negative correlations with uncertainty were found in the left hippocampus, right amygdale, and right middle temporal gyrus. The drug intervention with methylphenidate revealed a differential picture. Uncertain information processing was associated with higher activation in the parietal association cortex and posterior cingulate cortex after placebo relative to methylphenidate. The methylphenidate challenge relative to placebo was associated with higher left and right parahippocampal as well as cerebellar activation under uncertainty. Apparently, the pro-dopaminergic pharmacological influence induces a relative shift towards recruitment of hippocampal areas under uncertainty, whereas under placebo conditions, higher levels of parietal cortex activations are involved in the task. The findings suggest a role of dopamine in uncertainty processing and shed light on the pharmacological mechanisms of methylphenidate.

Fear-related memory also involves the GABAergic system, although no influence on inhibitory synaptic transmission is known. In the present study we assessed the influence of Pavlovian fear conditioning on the plasticity of GABAergic synaptic interactions in the lateral amygdala (LA) in brain slices prepared from fear-conditioned, pseudo-trained and na{\"\i}ve adult mice. Theta-burst tetanization of thalamic afferent inputs to the LA evoked an input-specific potentiation of inhibitory postsynaptic responses in projection neurons; the cortical input was unaffected. Philanthotoxin (10~\ensuremath{\mathrm{\mu}}m), an antagonist of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors, disabled this plastic phenomenon. Surgical isolation of the LA, extracellular application of a GABAB receptor antagonist (CGP~55845A, 10~\ensuremath{\mathrm{\mu}}m) or an NMDA receptor antagonist (APV, 50~\ensuremath{\mathrm{\mu}}m), or intracellular application of BAPTA (10~mm), did not influence the plasticity. The plasticity also showed as a potentiation of monosynaptic excitatory responses in putative GABAergic interneurons. Pavlovian fear conditioning, but not pseudo-conditioning, resulted in a significant reduction in this potentiation that was evident 24~h after training. Two weeks after training, the potentiation returned to control levels. In conclusion, a reduction in potentiation of inhibitory synaptic interactions occurs in the LA and may contribute to a shift in synaptic balance towards excitatory signal flow during the processes of fear-memory acquisition or consolidation.},

  abstract = {Converging evidence from cellular, electrophysiological, anatomic, and behavioral studies suggests that the remodeling of synapse structure and function is a critical component of cognition. This modulation of neuroplasticity can be achieved through the actions of numerous extracellular signals. Moreover, it is thought that it is the integration of different extracellular signals regulation of neuroplasticity that greatly influences cognitive function. One group of signals that exerts powerful effects on multiple neurologic processes is estrogens. Classically, estrogens have been described to exert their effects over a period of hours to days. However, there is now increasing evidence that estrogens can rapidly influence multiple behaviors, including those that require forebrain neural circuitry. Moreover, these effects are found in both sexes. Critically, it is now emerging that the modulation of cognition by rapid estrogenic signaling is achieved by activation of specific signaling cascades and regulation of synapse structure and function, cumulating in the rewiring of neural circuits. The importance of understanding the rapid effects of estrogens on forebrain function and circuitry is further emphasized as investigations continue to consider the potential of estrogenic-based therapies for neuropathologies. This review focuses on how estrogens can rapidly influence cognition and the emerging mechanisms that underlie these effects. We discuss the potential sources and the biosynthesis of estrogens within the brain and the consequences of rapid estrogenic-signaling on the remodeling of neural circuits. Furthermore, we argue that estrogens act via distinct signaling pathways to modulate synapse structure and function in a manner that may vary with cell type, developmental stage, and sex. Finally, we present a model in which the coordination of rapid estrogenic-signaling and activity-dependent stimuli can result in long-lasting changes in neural circuits, contributing to cognition, with potential relevance for the development of novel estrogenic-based therapies for neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders.},

  abstract = {The M4 muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (mAChR) is a potential therapeutic target but characterized by a lack of subtype-selective ligands. We recently generated "designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug" (DREADDs), which contained mutations of two conserved orthosteric-site residues (Y113C/A203G in the M4 mAChR) that caused a loss of ACh activity but a gain in responsiveness to clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). The current study characterized the interactions of the wild type and the M4 DREADD with a range of agonists, antagonists, and the recently discovered M4 mAChR allosteric potentiator, 3-amino-5-chloro-6-methoxy-4-methyl-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid cyclopropylamide (LY2033298). LY2033298 displayed positive binding cooperativity with ACh, neutral cooperativity with the antagonist, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, and agonism for activation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 at the wild-type M4 mAChR. LY2033298's cooperativity with clozapine or CNO was weakly positive with respect to binding but profoundly negative with respect to LY2033298 signaling. Although the DREADD mutations increased the binding and function of clozapine-like compounds, all other agonists lost the ability to activate the mutant; for the orthosteric agonists ACh and pilocarpine, this was due partly to a reduced affinity, whereas the affinity of LY2033298 or the atypical agonist 4-I-[3-chlorophenyl]carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammnonium chloride was unaltered. The interaction between LY2033298 and clozapine-like compounds reverted to neutral cooperativity on the DREADD, whereas LY2033298 caused a striking functional rescue of ACh potency and efficacy at the DREADD. These results provide conclusive evidence for the retention of a functional allosteric site on the M4 DREADD and highlight a role for residues Tyr113 and Ala203 in the transmission of cooperativity.},

Although the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is known to play a critical role in the formation of memories of both positive and negative valence, the coding and routing of valence-related information is poorly understood. Here, we recorded BLA neurons during the retrieval of associative memories and used optogenetic-mediated phototagging to identify populations of neurons that synapse in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the central amygdala (CeA), or ventral hippocampus (vHPC). We found that despite heterogeneous neural responses within each population, the proportions of BLA-NAc neurons excited by reward predictive cues and of BLA-CeA neurons excited by aversion predictive cues were higher than within the entire BLA. Although the BLA-vHPC projection is known to drive behaviors of innate negative valence, these neurons did not preferentially code for learned negative valence. Together, these findings suggest that valence encoding in the BLA is at least partially mediated via divergent activity of anatomically defined neural populations.},

IEGs can be divided into two functional classes: (1) regulatory transcription factors (RTFs), which can broadly influence cell function depending on the "downstream" genes they regulate, and (2) "effector" proteins, which may directly modulate specific cellular functions. The objective of the current study was to determine whether the expression of an effector IEG (Arc) was similar to, or different from, that of two well characterized RTF IEGs (c-fos and zif268) after learning. IEG RNA levels from rats trained in spatial and nonspatial water tasks were determined using RNase protection assays and in situ hybridization. Overall, the regulation of the three IEGs was similar in the hippocampus and the entorhinal and primary visual cortices. Consequently, IEG RNA levels were positively correlated within a structure. By contrast, Arc and zif268 RNA levels were not correlated or only weakly correlated across structures, although c-fos RNA levels were moderately correlated across structures. Arc RNA expression differed from that of zif268 and c-fos in two regards: (1) hippocampal Arc RNA levels were correlated with learning of the hippocampal-dependent spatial, but not hippocampal-independent cued response, water task, and (2) Arc RNA levels in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex increased after spatial reversal learning relative to an asymptotic performance group. Thus, although the expression of Arc, zif268, and c-fos exhibited many similarities, Arc was most responsive to differences in behavioral task demands.},

Despite recent progresses in identifying neuronal populations involved in memory coding, the synapse-level mechanism is still poorly understood. Computational models and electrophysiological data have shown that functional clustering of synapses along dendritic branches leads to nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs and greatly expands the computing power of a neural network. However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy, we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines. Our findings suggest that clustering of new synapses along dendrites is induced by repetitive activation of the cortical circuitry during learning, providing a structural basis for spatial coding of motor memory in the mammalian brain.},

Results: The majority of participants completed the training and reported high satisfaction with the training. Pre\textemdash{}post improvements in self-reported ADHD symptoms and test performance on tasks measuring attention and cognitive inhibition were noted. Improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms were also observed.

  abstract = {The development of stimulus selectivity in the primary sensory cortex of higher vertebrates is considered in a general mathematical framework. A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data.

  abstract = {Sigma receptors were first described as one of the opiate receptor subtypes. Now it is well established that sigma receptors, existing as subtypes sigma-1 and sigma-2, are unique non-opioid receptors which are implicated in higher-ordered brain functions. Sigma-1 receptors have high to moderate affinities for (+)benzomorphans and also many psychotrophic drugs and neurosteroids. Sigma-1 receptor agonists and certain neurosteroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) have antidepressant-like effects in animal behavioral models of depression. The antidepressant-like effect induced by sigma-1 receptor agonists may involve intracellular Ca (2+) mobilization such that sigma-1 receptor agonists modulate Ca (2+) release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a cytoskeletal protein-dependent manner. In addition, growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth is mediated through sigma-1 receptors, suggesting a role of antidepressants in neuroplasticity. Igmesine (JO1783), OPC-14 523 and SA4503, have recently been developed as sigma-1 agonists and are found to have antidepressant-like activity perhaps with fewer side effects. This article reviews the new potential use of sigma-1 receptor ligands in the treatment of mood disorder.},

  doi = {10.1038/npp.2014.197},
  abstract = {After acquisition, hippocampus-dependent memories undergo a systems consolidation process, during which they become independent of the hippocampus and dependent on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for memory expression. However, consolidated remote memories can become transiently hippocampus-dependent again following memory reactivation. How this systems reconsolidation affects the role of the ACC in remote memory expression is not known. Using contextual fear conditioning, we show that the expression of 30-day-old remote memory can transiently be supported by either the ACC or the dorsal hippocampus following memory reactivation, and that the ACC specifically mediates expression of remote generalized contextual fear memory. We found that suppression of neural activity in the ACC with the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) impaired the expression of remote, but not recent, contextual fear memory. Fear expression was not affected by this treatment if preceded by memory reactivation 6\,h earlier, nor was it affected by suppression of neural activity in the dorsal hippocampus with the GABA-receptor agonist muscimol. However, simultaneous targeting of both the ACC and the dorsal hippocampus 6\,h after memory reactivation disrupted contextual fear memory expression. Second, we observed that expression of a 30-day-old generalized contextual fear memory in a novel context was not affected by memory reactivation 6\,h earlier. However, intra-ACC CNQX infusion before testing impaired contextual fear expression in the novel context, but not the original training context. Together, these data suggest that although the dorsal hippocampus may be recruited during systems reconsolidation, the ACC remains necessary for the expression of generalized contextual fear memory.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 3 September 2014; doi:10.1038/npp.2014.197.},

In this task subjects learned which of two outcomes would occur on each trial after presentation of a particular combination of cues. Ten minutes of anodal, but not cathodal, stimulation improved implicit learning only when the left PFC was stimulated. Our results show that implicit PLC can be modified by weak anodal tDCS, which probably increases neural excitability, as has been shown in the motor and visual cortices previously. Our results suggest that further studies on the facilitation of learning and memory processes by tDCS are warranted.},

Here we show that GLYX-13, a novel NMDAR glycine-site functional partial agonist, produces an antidepressant-like effect in the Porsolt, novelty induced hypophagia, and learned helplessness tests in rats without exhibiting substance abuse-related, gating, and sedative side effects of ketamine in the drug discrimination, conditioned place preference, pre-pulse inhibition and open-field tests. Like ketamine, the GLYX-13-induced antidepressant-like effects required AMPA/kainate receptor activation, as evidenced by the ability of NBQX to abolish the antidepressant-like effect. Both GLYX-13 and ketamine persistently (24 h) enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission and the magnitude of NMDAR-NR2B conductance at rat Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in vitro. Cell surface biotinylation studies showed that both GLYX-13 and ketamine led to increases in both NR2B and GluR1 protein levels, as measured by Western analysis, whereas no changes were seen in mRNA expression (microarray and qRT-PCR). GLYX-13, unlike ketamine, produced its antidepressant-like effect when injected directly into the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). These results suggest that GLYX-13 produces an antidepressant-like effect without the side effects seen with ketamine at least in part by directly modulating NR2B-containing NMDARs in the MPFC. Furthermore, the enhancement of `metaplasticity' by both GLYX-13 and ketamine may help explain the long-lasting antidepressant effects of these NMDAR modulators. GLYX-13 is currently in a Phase II clinical development program for treatment-resistant depression.},

Here we introduce an idea for the gating of multiple signals in cortical networks that combines principles of signal propagation with aspects of balanced networks. Specifically, we studied networks in which incoming excitatory signals are normally cancelled by locally evoked inhibition, leaving the targeted layer unresponsive. Transmission can be gated 'on' by modulating excitatory and inhibitory gains to upset this detailed balance. We illustrate gating through detailed balance in large networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. We show successful gating of multiple signals and study failure modes that produce effects reminiscent of clinically observed pathologies. Provided that the individual signals are detectable, detailed balance has a large capacity for gating multiple signals.},

  doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-13-213},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative analysis of changes in dendritic spine morphology has become an interesting issue in contemporary neuroscience. However, the diversity in dendritic spine population might seriously influence the result of measurements in which their morphology is studied. The detection of differences in spine morphology between control and test group is often compromised by the number of dendritic spines taken for analysis. In order to estimate the impact of dendritic spine diversity we performed Monte Carlo simulations examining various experimental setups and statistical approaches. The confocal images of dendritic spines from hippocampal dissociated cultures have been used to create a set of variables exploited as the simulation resources.
RESULTS: The tabulated results of simulations given in this article, provide the number of dendritic spines required for the detection of hidden morphological differences between control and test groups in terms of spine head-width, length and area. It turns out that this is the head-width among these three variables, where the changes are most easily detected. Simulation of changes occurring in a subpopulation of spines reveal the strong dependence of detectability on the statistical approach applied. The analysis based on comparison of percentage of spines in subclasses is less sensitive than the direct comparison of relevant variables describing spines morphology.
CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated the sampling aspect and effect of systematic morphological variation on detecting the differences in spine morphology. The results provided here may serve as a guideline in selecting the number of samples to be studied in a planned experiment. Our simulations might be a step towards the development of a standardized method of quantitative comparison of dendritic spines morphology, in which different sources of errors are considered.},

  abstract = {Normal aging is known to result in a reduction of gray matter within the hippocampal complex, particularly in the subiculum. The present study was designed to address the question whether the practice of meditation can amend this age-related subicular atrophy. For this purpose, we established the correlations between subicular volume and chronological age within 50 long-term meditators and 50 control subjects. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were automatically processed combining cytoarchitectonically defined probabilistic maps with advanced tissue segmentation and registration methods. Overall, we observed steeper negative regression slopes in controls. The analysis further revealed a significant group-by-age interaction for the left subiculum with a significant negative correlation between age and subicular volume in controls, but no significant correlation in meditators. Altogether, these findings seem to suggest a reduced age-related atrophy of the left subiculum in meditators compared to healthy controls. Possible explanations might be a relative increase of subicular tissue over time through long-term training as meditation is a process that incorporates regular and ongoing mental efforts. Alternatively, because meditation is an established form of reducing stress, our observation might reflect an overall preservation of subicular tissue through a reduced neuronal vulnerability to negative effects of stress.},

Prefrontal areas varied vastly in their connections with the amygdala, with the densest connections found in posterior orbitofrontal and posterior medial cortices, and the sparsest in anterior lateral prefrontal areas, especially area 10. Prefrontal projection neurons directed to the amygdala originated in layer 5, but significant numbers were also found in layers 2 and 3 in posterior medial and orbitofrontal cortices. Amygdalar axonal terminations in prefrontal cortex were most frequently distributed in bilaminar bands in the superficial and deep layers, by columns spanning the entire cortical depth, and less frequently as small patches centered in the superficial or deep layers. Heavy terminations in layers 1-2 overlapped with calbindin-positive inhibitory neurons. A comparison of the relationship of input to output projections revealed that among the most heavily connected cortices, cingulate areas 25 and 24 issued comparatively more projections to the amygdala than they received, whereas caudal orbitofrontal areas were more receivers than senders. Further, there was a significant relationship between the proportion of 'feedforward' cortical projections from layers 2-3 to 'feedback' terminations innervating the superficial layers of prefrontal cortices. These findings indicate that the connections between prefrontal cortices and the amygdala follow similar patterns as corticocortical connections, and by analogy suggest pathways underlying the sequence of information processing for emotions.},

We use this social reward as an unconditioned stimulus and pair it with a distinct visual environment. After training, larvae exhibited spatial preference for the location previously paired with the social reward for up to 36 h, indicating that zebrafish larvae can exhibit long-term associative memory. Furthermore, incubation with a protein synthesis inhibitor or an NMDAR-antagonist impaired memory. In future experiments, this learning paradigm could be used to study the social interactions of larval zebrafish or paired with cell-specific metabolic labeling to visualize circuits underlying memory formation.},

  abstract = {Recent human clinical studies with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine have revealed profound and long-lasting antidepressant effects with rapid onset in several clinical trials, but antidepressant effects were preceded by dissociative side effects. Here we show that GLYX-13, a novel NMDAR glycine-site functional partial agonist, produces an antidepressant-like effect in the Porsolt, novelty induced hypophagia, and learned helplessness tests in rats without exhibiting substance abuse-related, gating, and sedative side effects of ketamine in the drug discrimination, conditioned place preference, pre-pulse inhibition and open-field tests. Like ketamine, the GLYX-13-induced antidepressant-like effects required AMPA/kainate receptor activation, as evidenced by the ability of NBQX to abolish the antidepressant-like effect. Both GLYX-13 and ketamine persistently (24 h) enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission and the magnitude of NMDAR-NR2B conductance at rat Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in vitro. Cell surface biotinylation studies showed that both GLYX-13 and ketamine led to increases in both NR2B and GluR1 protein levels, as measured by Western analysis, whereas no changes were seen in mRNA expression (microarray and qRT-PCR). GLYX-13, unlike ketamine, produced its antidepressant-like effect when injected directly into the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). These results suggest that GLYX-13 produces an antidepressant-like effect without the side effects seen with ketamine at least in part by directly modulating NR2B-containing NMDARs in the MPFC. Furthermore, the enhancement of `metaplasticity' by both GLYX-13 and ketamine may help explain the long-lasting antidepressant effects of these NMDAR modulators. GLYX-13 is currently in a Phase II clinical development program for treatment-resistant depression.},

This review outlines the current literature regarding the use of NAC in disorders including addiction, compulsive and grooming disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. N-acetylcysteine has shown promising results in populations with these disorders, including those in whom treatment efficacy has previously been limited.

  doi = {10.1093/cercor/bhs315},
  abstract = {One conceptual mechanism for the induction of associative long-term memory is that a synaptic tag, set by a weak event, can capture plasticity-related proteins from a nearby strong input, thus enabling associativity between the 2 (synaptic tagging and capture, STC). So far, STC has been observed for only a limited time of 60 min. Nevertheless, association of weak memory forms can occur beyond this period and its mechanism is not well understood. Here we report that metaplasticity induced by ryanodine receptor activation or synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors prolongs the durability of the synaptic tag, thus extending the time window for associative interactions mediating storage of long-term memory. We provide evidence that such metaplasticity alters the mechanisms of STC from a CaMKII-mediated (in non-primed STC) to a protein kinase Mzeta (PKM\ensuremath{\zeta})-mediated process (in primed STC). Thus the association of weak synapses with strong synapses in the "late" stage of associative memory formation occurs only through metaplasticity. The results also reveal that the short-lived, CaMKII-mediated tag may contribute to a mechanism for a fragile form of memory while metaplasticity enables a PKM\ensuremath{\zeta}-mediated synaptic tag capable of prolonged interactions that induce a more stable form of memory that is resistant to reversal.},

This article summarizes what is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling spore assembly with particular attention to how constitutive cellular functions are modified to create novel behaviors during this developmental process.

  abstract = {Long-term memory (LTM) formation requires transient changes in the activity of intracellular signaling cascades that are thought to regulate new gene transcription and de novo protein synthesis in the brain. Consistent with this, protein synthesis inhibitors impair LTM for a variety of behavioral tasks when infused into the brain around the time of training or following memory retrieval, suggesting that protein synthesis is a critical step in LTM storage in the brain. However, evidence suggests that protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) may also be a critical regulator of LTM formation and stability following retrieval. This requirement for increased protein degradation has been shown in the same brain regions in which protein synthesis is required for LTM storage. Additionally, increases in the phosphorylation of proteins involved in translational control parallel increases in protein polyubiquitination and the increased demand for protein degradation is regulated by intracellular signaling molecules thought to regulate protein synthesis during LTM formation. In some cases inhibiting proteasome activity can rescue memory impairments that result from pharmacological blockade of protein synthesis, suggesting that protein degradation may control the requirement for protein synthesis during the memory storage process. Results such as these suggest that protein degradation and synthesis are both critical for LTM formation and may interact to properly "consolidate" and store memories in the brain. Here, we review the evidence implicating protein synthesis and degradation in LTM storage and highlight the areas of overlap between these two opposing processes. We also discuss evidence suggesting these two processes may interact to properly form and store memories. LTM storage likely requires a coordinated regulation between protein degradation and synthesis at multiple sites in the mammalian brain.},

Across the baseline period, neurons displayed heterogeneous yet stable responsiveness. During sensory deprivation, responses to trimmed whisker stimulation globally decreased, whereas responses to spared whisker stimulation increased for the least active neurons and decreased for the most active neurons. These findings suggest that recruitment of inactive, 'silent' neurons is part of a convergent redistribution of population activity underlying sensory map plasticity.

In the current study, the authors trained older adults in a real-time strategy video game for 23.5 hr in an effort to improve their executive functions. A battery of cognitive tasks, including tasks of executive control and visuospatial skills, were assessed before, during, and after video-game training. The trainees improved significantly in the measures of game performance.

Yet almost nothing is known about their neural correlates in the human. We therefore used fMRI to measure brain activity in mothers while they viewed pictures of their own and of acquainted children, and of their best friend and of acquainted adults as additional controls. The activity specific to maternal attachment was compared to that associated to romantic love described in our earlier study and to the distribution of attachment-mediating neurohormones established by other studies. Both types of attachment activated regions specific to each, as well as overlapping regions in the brain's reward system that coincide with areas rich in oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Both deactivated a common set of regions associated with negative emotions, social judgment and `mentalizing', that is, the assessment of other people's intentions and emotions. We conclude that human attachment employs a push\textendash{}pull mechanism that overcomes social distance by deactivating networks used for critical social assessment and negative emotions, while it bonds individuals through the involvement of the reward circuitry, explaining the power of love to motivate and exhilarate.},

  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in the lateral amygdala (LA) is believed to underlie the formation and retention of fear memories. To explore the role of inhibitory transmission in amygdala plasticity, we recorded from LA inhibitory interneurons in vitro before and after tetanization of the thalamo-LA pathway, one of the major inputs to LA involved in fear learning. Tetanization resulted in LTP of the EPSPs elicited in both the tetanized thalamic pathway and the untetanized cortical pathway to LA. This LTP was NMDA-dependent and associated with a decrease in paired-pulse facilitation in both pathways. In LA excitatory cells, LTP of interneurons resulted in an increase in the amplitude of GABAergic IPSPs in both input pathways. Finally, isolated GABAergic IPSPs between inhibitory and excitatory neurons could be potentiated as well. Plasticity of inhibitory transmission within the LA may therefore contribute significantly to LA-mediated functions, such as fear conditioning.},

  abstract = {Preconditioning brain with a sub-lethal stressor can temporarily generate a damage-refractory state. Microarray analyses have defined the changes in hippocampal gene expression that follow brief preconditioning seizures, but not the transcriptome after a prolonged and otherwise injurious seizure in previously preconditioned brain. Presently, microarray analysis was performed 24~h after status epilepticus in mice that had received previously either seizure preconditioning (tolerance) or sham-preconditioning (injury). Transcriptional changes in the hippocampal CA3 subfield of \ensuremath{\geq} 2 fold were detected for 1357 genes in the tolerance group compared to a non-seizure control group, with 54\% up-regulated. Of these regulated genes, 792 were also regulated in the injury group. Among the remaining 565 genes regulated only in tolerance, 73\% were down-regulated. Analysis of the genes differentially suppressed in tolerance identified calcium signaling, ion channels and excitatory neurotransmitter receptors, and the synapse as over-represented among pathways, functions and compartments. Finally, 12~days continuous EEG recordings determined mice with induced tolerance had fewer spontaneous electrographic seizures compared to the injury group. Our data suggest the transcriptional phenotype of neuroprotection in tolerance may be dictated by the biology of the preconditioning stressor, functions by transcriptional reduction of vulnerability to excitotoxicity, and has anti-epileptogenic effects.},

  shorttitle = {Three-dimensional structure of dendritic spines and synapses in rat hippocampus ({{CA1}}) at postnatal day 15 and adult ages},
  abstract = {It has long been hypothesized that changes in dendritic spine structure may modify the physiological properties of synapses located on them. Due to their small size, large number, and highly variable shapes, standard light microscopy of Golgi impregnations and electron microscopy (EM) of single thin sections have not proved adequate to identify most spines in a sample or to quantify their structural dimensions and composition. Here we describe a new approach, the series sample, that was developed to classify by shape and subcellular composition all of the spines and synapses in a sample of neuropil by viewing them through serial EM sections. Spines in each class are then randomly selected for serial reconstruction and measurement in three dimensions. This approach was used to assess whether structural changes in hippocampal CA1 spines could contribute to the enhanced synaptic transmission and the greater endurance of long-term potentiation (LTP) that occur with maturation. Our results show a near doubling in the total density of synapses in the neuropil and along reconstructed dendrites between postnatal day 15 (PND 15) and adult ages. However, this doubling does not occur uniformly across all spine and synapse morphologies. Thin spines, mushroom spines containing perforated postsynaptic densities (PSDs) and spine apparatuses, and branched spines increase by about four-fold in density between PND 15 and adult ages. In contrast, stubby spines decrease by more than half and no change occurs in mushroom spines with macular PSDs or in dendritic shaft synapses. The stubby spines that remain are smaller in adults than at PND 15 and the mushroom spines are larger, while no change occurs in the three-dimensional structure of thin spines. Only a few spine necks at either age are constricted or long enough to attenuate charge transfer; therefore, the doubling in synapses should mediate the enhancement of synaptic transmission that occurs with maturation. In addition, LTP is not likely to be mediated by widening of spine necks at either age. However, the constricted spine necks could serve to concentrate specific molecules at activated synapses, thereby enhancing the specificity and endurance of LTP with maturation. These results demonstrate that the new series sample method combined with three-dimensional reconstruction reveals quantitative changes in the frequency and structure of spines and synapses that are not discernable by other methods and are likely to have dramatic effects on synaptic physiology and plasticity.},

  abstract = {Fear memories guide adaptive behavior in contexts associated with aversive events. The hippocampus forms a neural representation of the context that predicts aversive events. Representations of context incorporate multisensory features of the environment, but must somehow exclude sensory features of the aversive event itself. We investigated this selectivity using cell type\textendash{}specific imaging and inactivation in hippocampal area CA1 of behaving mice. Aversive stimuli activated CA1 dendrite-targeting interneurons via cholinergic input, leading to inhibition of pyramidal cell distal dendrites receiving aversive sensory excitation from the entorhinal cortex. Inactivating dendrite-targeting interneurons during aversive stimuli increased CA1 pyramidal cell population responses and prevented fear learning. We propose subcortical activation of dendritic inhibition as a mechanism for exclusion of aversive stimuli from hippocampal contextual representations during fear learning.
Fear, Memory, and Place
Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is widely used as a hippocampal-dependent classical conditioning task to model human episodic memory. Lovett-Barron et al. (p. 857) combined in vivo imaging with pharmacology, pharmacogenetics, and optogenetics and they found that somatostatin-expressing, dendrite-targeting \ensuremath{\gamma}-aminobutyric acid\textendash{}releasing interneurons in hippocampal area CA1 are required for CFC. During CFC, sensory features of the aversive event reach hippocampal output neurons through excitatory cortical afferents and require active inhibitory filtering to ensure that the hippocampus exclusively encodes the conditioned stimulus.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if group housing affects the variance of body composition parameters in a highly inbred mouse strain.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Thirty 3-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Fifteen mice were housed individually, and 15 mice were housed in groups of 5/cage. Animals were fed ad libitum and maintained in the same room under a 12:12-hour light/dark photoperiod at 22 degrees C for 9 weeks. Animals were killed, and fat mass, soft-lean tissue mass, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone mineral content (BMC) were determined by DXA. At necropsy, weights of the paired epididymal fat pads, paired retroperitoneal fat pads, right inguinal fat pad, liver, kidneys, paired testes, and seminal vesicles were obtained.
RESULTS: Relative to mice housed singly, group-housed mice showed significantly greater variance in percentage of body fat, testes weight, and BMC. Group-housed mice tended to show greater variance in liver weights and BMD. Mice housed singly were smaller, had less soft-lean tissue mass and BMC, and lower BMD when compared with group-housed mice.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that with respect to body composition parameters, mice housed singly are more similar to one another than are group-housed mice, most likely because of a reduction in environmental (predominately behavioral/social) effects. Thus, mice housed singly may be more representative of genotypic effects on body composition than group-housed mice. Whether other inbred strains of mice show similar responses to housing condition is unknown.},

  abstract = {Microinjection of opioid agonists, such as morphine, into the nucleus accumbens shell produces increases in eating behavior (i.e. 'wanting' for food). This study (1) reports direct evidence that activation of accumbens opioid receptors in rats also augments food 'liking', or the hedonic impact of taste, and (2) identified a neural site that definitely contains receptors capable of increasing food intake. Morphine microinjections (0.5 mu g) into accumbens shell, which caused rats to increase eating, were found also to cause selective increases in positive hedonic patterns of behavioral affective reaction elicited by oral sucrose, using the 'taste reactivity' test of hedonic palatability. This positive shift indicated that morphine microinjections enhanced the hedonic impact of food palatability. The accumbens site mediating morphine-induced increases in food 'wanting' and 'liking' was identified using a novel method based on local expression of Fos induced directly by drug microinjections. The plume-shaped region of drug-induced increase in Fos immunoreactivity immediately surrounding a morphine microinjection site (Fos plume) was objectively mapped. A point-sampling procedure was used to measure the shape and size of 'positive' plumes of Fos expression triggered by microinjections of morphine at locations that caused increases in eating behavior. This revealed a functionally 'positive' neural region, containing receptors directly activated by behaviorally-effective drug microinjections. A subtraction mapping procedure was then used to eliminate all surrounding regions containing any 'negative' Fos plumes that failed to increase food intake. The subtraction produced a conservative map of the positive site, by eliminating regions that gave mixed effects, and leaving only a positive region that must contain receptors capable of mediating increases in food intake. The resulting mapped 'opioid eating site' was contained primarily within the medial caudal subregion of the nucleus accumbens shell, and did not substantially penetrate either into the accumbens core or into other subregions of the shell. Several other structures outside the nucleus accumbens (such as rostral ventral pallidum), immediately medial and adjacent to the shell, also appeared to be included in the functional site. Opioid receptors within this site thus are capable of mediating morphine-induced increases in eating, in part by enhancing the hedonic reward properties of food. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN.

Mef2-induced expression of at least three individual miRNAs of the miR379\textendash{}410 cluster is required for activity-dependent dendritic outgrowth of hippocampal neurons.

At first the stimulation had little effect on behavior and did not cause electrographic afterdischarge. With repetition the response to stimulation progressively changed to include localized seizure discharge, behavioral automatisms and, eventually, bilateral clonic convulsions. Thereafter, the animal responded to each daily burst of stimulation with a complete convulsion. The effect was obtained from bipolar stimulation of loci associated with the limbic system, but not from stimulation of many other regions of the brain. Parametric studies and control observations revealed that the effect was due to electrical activation and not to tissue damage, poison, edema, or gliosis. The changes in brain function were shown to be both permanent and trans-synaptic in nature. Massed-trial stimulation, with short inter-burst intervals, rarely led to convulsions. The number of stimulation trials necessary to elicit the first convulsion decreased as the interval between trials approached 24 hours. Further increase in the inter-trial interval had little effect on the number of trials to first convulsion. High-intensity stimulation studies revealed that the development of convulsions was not based simply on threshold reduction, but involved complex reorganization of function. Experiments with two electrodes in separate parts of the limbic system revealed that previously established convulsions could facilitate the establishment of a second convulsive focus, but that the establishment of this second convulsive focus partially suppressed the otherwise permanent convulsive properties of the original focus.},

All the reported PV-positive GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia seemed to be included in the GFP-positive cells. We found GFP-positive layer V pyramidal neurons inhabit a broader neocortical area than was previously reported. They were located in the primary somatosensory, motor, and visual areas. The somatosensory area of the neocortex contained the greatest number of PV-positive pyramidal neurons. A large number of thalamic relay neurons and virtually all the reticular thalamic neurons appeared as GFP-positive. Thalamic relay nucleus and a neocortical area for the same modality corresponded and seemed to contain a characteristic amount of PV-positive excitatory neurons.},

  abstract = {The impact of a single seizure on cognition remains controversial. We hypothesized that a single early life seizure (sELS) on rat post-natal day (P) 7 would alter only hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in mature (P60) rats. The Morris Water Maze (MWM), Novel Object and Novel Place Recognition (NOR/NPR) tasks, and Contextual Fear Conditioning (CFC) were used to assess learning and memory associated with hippocampal/prefrontal cortex, perirhinal/hippocampal cortex, and amygdala function, respectively. The Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and Open Field Test (OFT) were used to assess anxiety associated with the septum. We report that sELS impaired hippocampal-dependent short-term memory but not spatial learning or recall. sELS did not disrupt performance in the NOR/NPR. CFC performance suggested intact amydgala function. sELS did not change anxiety levels as measured by the EPM or OFT. Our data suggests that the long-term cognitive impacts of sELS are largely limited to the hippocampus/prefrontal cortex.},

  abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that the processes of memory formation and storage are exquisitely dynamic. Elucidating the nature and temporal evolution of the biological changes that accompany encoding, storage, and retrieval is key to understand memory formation. For explicit or medial temporal lobe-dependent memories that form after a discrete event and are stored for a long time, the physical changes underlying the encoding and processing of the information (memory trace or engram) remain in a fragile state for some time. However, over time, the new memory becomes increasingly resistant to disruption until it is consolidated. Retrieval or reactivation of an apparently consolidated memory can render the memory labile again, and reconsolidation is the process that occurs to mediate its restabilization. Reconsolidation also evolves with the age of the memory: Young memories are sensitive to post-reactivation disruption, but older memories are more resistant. Why does a memory become labile again if it is retrieved or reactivated? Here I suggest that the main function of reconsolidation is to contribute to the lingering consolidation process and mediate memory strengthening. I also discuss the literature and results regarding the influence of the passage of time on the reconsolidation of memory. These points have important implications for the use of reconsolidation in therapeutic settings.},

Fourteen subjects with memory problems had an IV inserted and were injected with 250MBq of Tc-99m ECD while listening to a neutral stimulus CD. They then underwent a pre-program baseline SPECT scan. Then subjects were guided through their first meditation session with a CD, during which they received an injection of 925MBq ECD, and underwent a pre-program meditation scan. Subjects completed an 8-week meditation program and underwent the same scanning protocol resulting in a post-program baseline and meditation scan. A region of interest (ROI) template obtained counts in each ROI normalized to whole brain to provide a CBF ratio. Baseline and meditation scans and neuropsychological testing were compared before and after the program. The meditation program resulted in significant increases (p\ensuremath{<} 0.05) in baseline CBF ratios in the prefrontal, superior frontal, and superior parietal cortices. Scores on neuropsychological tests of verbal fluency, Trails B, and logical memory showed improvements after training. This preliminary study evaluated whether an 8-week meditation program resulted in improvements in neuropsychological function and differences in CBF in subjects with memory loss. While the findings are encouraging, there are a number of limitations that can be addressed in future studies with more participants and more detailed analyses.},

Recent 'capture' studies use novel approaches to tag populations of neurons that are active during memory encoding, thereby allowing these engram-associated neurons to be manipulated at later times. We propose that findings from these capture studies represent considerable progress in allowing us to observe, erase and express the engram.},

  abstract = {Physiological studies suggest that afferents to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) from the auditory thalamus initiate feedforward inhibition [Li et al. (1996b)]. This model of neural processing requires that thalamic afferents synapse directly onto inhibitory interneurons. To determine whether such synaptic contacts occur, we combined anterograde tract tracing with interneuron immunocytochemistry. The anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected into the auditory thalamus. Inhibitory interneurons in the LA were identified using antibodies directed against gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) or one of the calcium binding proteins (CBPs), parvalbumin (PARV), calbindin (CALB), or calretinin (CALR), since CBPs identify distinct populations of GABAergic cells within the amygdala. The distribution of GABAergic and CBP interneurons in each subregion of the LA was examined by light microscopy and the relationships between thalamo-amygdala terminals and interneurons were examined by confocal and electron microscopy. Immunoreactive cells were distributed in all three subdivisions of LA, except for CALR-ir neurons, which were sparse in the dorsal subregion and were found mainly in the ventromedial and ventrolateral subregions. Confocal microscopy revealed some thalamo-amygdala terminals in close proximity to LA interneurons, while electron microscopy showed that thalamo-amygdala terminals made direct synaptic contacts onto distal dendritic processes of inhibitory neurons. These data provide morphological evidence that thalamic afferents synapse directly onto inhibitory interneurons in LA, and are consistent with the possibility that inputs from the auditory thalamus initiate feedforward inhibition in LA. This architecture could play an important role in the suppression of background neural noise, thereby enhancing the response of LA cells to incoming auditory stimuli.},

  abstract = {Aging in humans is accompanied by a progressive decline in the secretion of the adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DS), paralleling that of the GH-insulin-like growth factor-I (GH-IGF-I) axis. Although the functional relationship of the decline of the GH-IGF-I system and catabolism is recognized, the biological role of DHEA in human aging remains undefined. To test the hypothesis that the decline in DHEA may contribute to the shift from anabolism to catabolism associated with aging, we studied the effect of a replacement dose of DHEA in 13 men and 17 women, 40-70 yr of age. A randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial of nightly oral DHEA administration (50 mg) of 6-month duration was conducted. During each treatment period, concentrations of androgens, lipids, apolipoproteins, IGF-I, IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-3, insulin sensitivity, percent body fat, libido, and sense of well-being were measured. A subgroup of men (n = 8) and women (n = 5) underwent 24-h sampling at 20-min intervals for GH determinations. DHEA and DS serum levels were restored to those found in young adults within 2 weeks of DHEA replacement and were sustained throughout the 3 months of the study. A 2-fold increase in serum levels of androgens (androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone) was observed in women, with only a small rise in androstenedione in men. There was no change in circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, estrone, or estradiol in either gender. High density lipoprotein levels declined slightly in women, with no other lipid changes noted for either gender. Insulin sensitivity and percent body fat were unaltered. Although mean 24-h GH and IGFBP-3 levels were unchanged, serum IGF-I levels increased significantly, and IGFBP-1 decreased significantly for both genders, suggesting an increased bioavailability of IGF-I to target tissues. This was associated with a remarkable increase in perceived physical and psychological well-being for both men (67\%) and women (84\%) and no change in libido. In conclusion, restoring DHEA and DS to young adult levels in men and women of advancing age induced an increase in the bioavailability of IGF-I, as reflected by an increase in IGF-I and a decrease in IGFBP-1 levels. These observations together with improvement of physical and psychological well-being in both genders and the absence of side-effects constitute the first demonstration of novel effects of DHEA replacement in age-advanced men and women.},

  abstract = {The last 10 years have witnessed a surge of interest for the mechanisms underlying the acquisition and extinction of classically conditioned fear responses. In part, this results from the realization that abnormalities in fear learning mechanisms likely participate in the development and/or maintenance of human anxiety disorders. The simplicity and robustness of this learning paradigm, coupled with the fact that the underlying circuitry is evolutionarily well conserved, make it an ideal model to study the basic biology of memory and identify genetic factors and neuronal systems that regulate the normal and pathological expressions of learned fear. Critical advances have been made in determining how modified neuronal functions upon fear acquisition become stabilized during fear memory consolidation and how these processes are controlled in the course of fear memory extinction. With these advances came the realization that activity in remote neuronal networks must be coordinated for these events to take place. In this paper, we review these mechanisms of coordinated network activity and the molecular cascades leading to enduring fear memory, and allowing for their extinction. We will focus on Pavlovian fear conditioning as a model and the amygdala as a key component for the acquisition and extinction of fear responses.},

APP is a prominent component of the adult as well as the developing brain. It is enriched in axonal growth cones (GCs) and has been implicated in cell adhesion and motility. We tested the hypothesis that APP is an extracellular matrix adhesion molecule in experiments that isolated the function of APP from that of well-established adhesion molecules. To this end we plated wild-type, APP-, or \ensuremath{\beta}1-integrin (Itgb1)- misexpressing mouse hippocampal neurons on matrices of either laminin, recombinant L1, or synthetic peptides binding specifically to Itgb1 s or APP. We measured GC adhesion, initial axonal outgrowth, and substrate preference on alternating matrix stripes and made the following observations: Substrates of APP-binding peptide alone sustain neurite outgrowth; APP dosage controls GC adhesion to laminin and APP-binding peptide as well as axonal outgrowth in Itgb1- independent manner; and APP directs GCs in contact guidance assays. It follows that APP is an independently operating cell adhesion molecule that affects the GC's phenotype on APP-binding matrices including laminin, and that it is likely to affect axon pathfinding in vivo.},

The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease. However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes, the largest gene set of any vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that approximately 70\% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and chromosomal regions that influence sex determination.},

This double-blind, randomized study tested tDCS at the same stimulation parameters as a previous positive study (1 mA current strength, five treatment sessions, active or sham, given on alternate days) in 40 depressed participants. Anodal stimulation was centred over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with the cathode placed on the lateral aspect of the contralateral orbit. tDCS was continued up to a total of ten active sessions per participant. Mood outcomes were measured by psychiatrist raters blind to treatment condition using the Montgomery\textendash{}Asberg and other depression rating scales. Psychomotor speed was assessed immediately before and after a single tDCS session and attention, frontal executive function, working memory and verbal learning were assessed after each group of five sessions. Overall depression scores improved significantly over ten tDCS treatments, but there was no between-group difference in the five-session, sham-controlled phase. tDCS was found to be safe, with no adverse effects on neuropsychological function, and only minor side-effects. It is recommended that the efficacy of tDCS in depression be further evaluated over a longer treatment period, using enhanced stimulation parameters.},

  volume = {9},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0109689},
  abstract = {There is a growing consensus that the brain makes simple choices, such as choosing between an apple and an orange, by assigning value to the options under consideration, and comparing those values to make a choice. There is also a consensus that value signals computed in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala play a critical role in the choice process. However, the nature of the flow of information between OFC and amygdala at the time of decision is still unknown. In order to study this question, simultaneous local field potentials were recorded from OFC and amygdala in human patients while they performed a simple food choice task. Although the interaction of these circuits has been studied in animals, this study examines the effective connectivity directly in the human brain on a moment-by-moment basis. A spectral conditional Granger causality analysis was performed in order to test if the modulation of activity goes mainly from OFC-to-amygdala, from amygdala-to-OFC, or if it is bi-directional. Influence from amygdala-to-OFC was dominant prior to the revealed choice, with a small but significant OFC influence on the amygdala earlier in the trial. Alpha oscillation amplitudes analyzed with the Hilbert-Huang transform revealed differences in choice valence coincident with temporally specific amygdala influence on the OFC.},

  abstract = {There are sex differences in the rates of many stress-sensitive psychological disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala are implicated in many of these disorders, understanding differential stress effects in these regions may shed light on the mechanisms underlying sex-dependent expression of disorders like depression and anxiety. Prefrontal cortex and amygdala are key regions in the neural circuitry underlying fear conditioning and extinction, which thus has emerged as a useful model of stress influences on the neural circuitry underlying regulation of emotional behavior. This review outlines the current literature on sex differences and stress effects on dendritic morphology within medial prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala. Such structural differences and/or alterations can have important effects on fear conditioning and extinction, behaviors that are mediated by the basolateral amygdala and prefrontal cortex, respectively. Given the importance of extinction-based exposure therapy as a treatment for anxiety disorders such as PTSD, understanding the neural mechanisms by which stress differentially influences fear learning and extinction in males and females is an important goal for developing sex-appropriate interventions for stress-related disorders.},

In particular, how some neurons rather than others are selectively engaged to encode memory remains largely unknown. Using virus-mediated gene delivery into a small subset of neurons in a given network, molecular imaging of neuronal activity, pharmacological perturbation of specific neurons' activity and animal behavior assays, recent studies have begun to provide insight into molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the selection of neurons for inclusion into a memory trace. Here, we focus on a review of recent findings supporting the hypothesis that the level of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP/Ca(2+)-response element binding protein) is a key factor governing which neurons are recruited to a given memory trace. These recent findings open a new perspective on memory trace at the neural circuit level and also raise many important questions. Future studies employing more advanced neurobiological techniques for targeting defined populations of neurons and manipulating their activity in time and space in a complex neural network will give answers to these newly emerging questions and extend our understanding of the neurobiological basis of the memory trace.},

The main effect of tDCS is to modulate cortical excitability depending on the polarity of the applied current. However, the underlying mechanism of neuromodulation is not well understood. A new generation of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems is described that are miniaturized, portable, and include wearable sensors. These developments provide an opportunity to couple fNIRS with tDCS, consistent with a neuroergonomics approach for joint neuroimaging and neurostimulation investigations of cognition in complex tasks and in naturalistic conditions. The effects of tDCS on complex task performance and the use of fNIRS for monitoring cognitive workload during task performance are described. Also explained is how fNIRS + tDCS can be used simultaneously for assessing spatial working memory. Mobile optical brain imaging is a promising neuroimaging tool that has the potential to complement tDCS for realistic applications in natural settings.},

Although the root causes of age-related cognitive decline are incompletely understood, psychophysical and neuropsychological evidence suggests that a significant contribution stems from poorer signal-to-noise conditions and down-regulated neuromodulatory system function in older brains. Because the brain retains a lifelong capacity for plasticity and adaptive reorganization, dimensions of negative reorganization should be at least partially reversible through the use of an appropriately designed training program. We report here results from such a training program targeting age-related cognitive decline. Data from a randomized, controlled trial using standardized measures of neuropsychological function as outcomes are presented. Significant improvements in assessments directly related to the training tasks and significant generalization of improvements to nonrelated standardized neuropsychological measures of memory (effect size of 0.25) were documented in the group using the training program. Memory enhancement appeared to be sustained after a 3-month no-contact follow-up period. Matched active control and no-contact control groups showed no significant change in memory function after training or at the 3-month follow-up. This study demonstrates that intensive, plasticity-engaging training can result in an enhancement of cognitive function in normal mature adults.},

Participants saw pictures of artifacts and generated aloud either the object's common use or an uncommon use for it, while receiving cathodal tDCS (1.5mA) either over left or right PFC, or sham stimulation. A forward digit span task served as a negative control for potential general effects of stimulation. Analysis of voice-onset reaction times and number of responses generated showed significant facilitative effects of left PFC stimulation for the uncommon, but not the common use generation task and no effects of stimulation on the control task. The results support the hypothesis that certain tasks may benefit from a state of diminished cognitive control.},

While LTP and LTD are extensively studied and their relevance to brain function is widely accepted, new experimental and theoretical work recently demonstrates that brain development and function relies on additional forms of plasticity, some of which occur at nonglutamatergic synapses. The strength of GABAergic synapses is modulated by activity, and new functions for inhibitory synaptic plasticity are emerging. Together with excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons shape the excitability and dynamic range of neural circuits. Thus, the understanding of inhibitory synaptic plasticity is crucial to fully comprehend the physiology of brain circuits. Here, I will review recent findings about plasticity at GABAergic synapses and discuss how it may contribute to circuit function.},

  abstract = {The functionality of adult neocortical circuits can be altered by novel experiences or learning. This functional plasticity appears to rely on changes in the strength of neuronal connections that were established during development. Here we will describe some of our studies in which we have addressed whether structural changes, including the remodeling of axons and dendrites with synapse formation and elimination, could underlie experience-dependent plasticity in the adult neocortex. Using 2-photon laser-scanning microscopes and transgenic mice expressing GFP in a subset of pyramidal cells, we have observed that a small subset of dendritic spines continuously appear and disappear on a daily basis, whereas the majority of spines persists for months. Axonal boutons from different neuronal classes displayed similar behavior, although the extent of remodeling varied. Under baseline conditions, new spines in the barrel cortex were mostly transient and rarely survived for more than a week. However, when every other whisker was trimmed, the generation and loss of persistent spines was enhanced. Ultrastructural reconstruction of previously imaged spines and boutons showed that new spines slowly form synapses. New spines persisting for a few days always had synapses, whereas very young spines often lacked synapses. New synapses were predominantly found on large, multi-synapse boutons, suggesting that spine growth is followed by synapse formation, preferentially on existing boutons. Altogether our data indicate that novel sensory experience drives the stabilization of new spines on subclasses of cortical neurons and promotes the formation of new synapses. These synaptic changes likely underlie experience-dependent functional remodeling of specific neocortical circuits.},

Growing evidence suggests that cognitive training programs may have the potential to counteract this decline. On the basis of a growing body of research that shows that meditation has positive effects on cognition in younger and middle-aged adults, meditation may be able to offset normal age-related cognitive decline or even enhance cognitive function in older adults. In this paper, we review studies investigating the effects of meditation on age-related cognitive decline. We searched the Web of Science (1900 to present), PsycINFO (1597 to present), MEDLINE (1950 to present), and CABI (1910 to present) to identify original studies investigating the effects of meditation on cognition and cognitive decline in the context of aging. Twelve studies were included in the review, six of which were randomized controlled trials. Studies involved a wide variety of meditation techniques and reported preliminary positive effects on attention, memory, executive function, processing speed, and general cognition. However, most studies had a high risk of bias and small sample sizes. Reported dropout rates were low and compliance rates high. We conclude that meditation interventions for older adults are feasible, and preliminary evidence suggests that meditation can offset age-related cognitive decline.},

As an extension of this work, we studied the biochemical and pharmacological properties of [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate binding to brain membranes and the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate on GABA-induced currents in cultured neurons. [3H]Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate binding depended upon incubation time, pH, protein concentration, and incubation temperature. Thermal denaturation or pretreatment of the membranes with protease or phospholipase A2 reduced the binding by 54\textendash{}85\%. The higher affinity [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate binding sites appeared to be associated with protein and with the GABAA receptor complex. Among substances known to interact with the GABAA receptor complex, pregnenolone sulfate, pentobarbital, and phenobarbital inhibited the binding of [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. High micromolar concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate inhibited [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding to rat brain membranes, primarily by reducing the binding affinities. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate also produced a concentration-dependent block of GABA-induced currents in cultured neurons from ventral mesencephalon (IC50 = 13 \ensuremath{\pm} 3\ensuremath{\mu}M). The results of this study are consistent with an action of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate as a negative noncompetitive modulator of the GABAA receptor. Because concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the brain undergo physiological variations, this neurosteroid may play a vital role in regulation of neuronal excitability in the central nervous system.},

However, it is known that seizures early in life result in changes in the brain that make it more vulnerable to subsequent seizure-induced injury (the so-called two-hit hypothesis). Whether this heightened vulnerability occurs immediately after the first seizure is not known. In this study, immature rats were exposed to status epilepticus (SE) followed by a series of 25 flurothyl-induced seizures, SE alone, 25 flurothyl-induced seizures alone, or no seizures. Rats exposed to SE and flurothyl seizures performed significantly poorer in the water maze 2 weeks following the last seizure compared with the other groups. No histological lesions were seen in any of the four groups. This study suggests that SE renders the immature brain vulnerable to further seizure-induced injury and this enhanced vulnerability occurs very quickly after the SE.},

Pairing of subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with back-propagating action potentials resulted in an amplification of dendritic action potentials and evoked calcium influx near the site of synaptic input. This pairing also induced a robust LTP, which was reduced when EPSPs were paired with non-back-propagating action potentials or when stimuli were unpaired. Action potentials thus provide a synaptically controlled, associative signal to the dendrites for Hebbian modifications of synaptic strength.},

However, the causal link between these synaptic processes and memory has been difficult to demonstrate. Here we show that fear conditioning, a type of associative memory, can be inactivated and reactivated by LTD and LTP, respectively. We began by conditioning an animal to associate a foot shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala, a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning. Subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTD conditioning to the auditory input inactivates memory of the shock. Then subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTP conditioning to the auditory input reactivates memory of the shock. Thus, we have engineered inactivation and reactivation of a memory using LTD and LTP, supporting a causal link between these synaptic processes and memory.},

  abstract = {The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region in the mammalian brain critical for memory encoding with a neuronal architecture and function that deviates considerably from other cortical areas. One of the major differences of the DG compared to other brain regions is the finding that the dentate gyrus generates new principal neurons that are continuously integrated into a fully functional neural circuit throughout life. Another distinguishing characteristic of the dentate network is that the majority of principal neurons are held under strong inhibition and rarely fire action potentials. These two findings raise the question why a predominantly silent network would need to continually incorporate more functional units. The sparse nature of the neural code in the DG is thought to be fundamental to dentate network function, yet the relationship between neurogenesis and low activity levels in the network remains largely unknown. Clues to the functional role of new neurons come from inquiries at the cellular as well as the behavioral level. Few studies have bridged the gap between these levels of inquiry by considering the role of young neurons within the complex dentate network during distinct stages of memory processing. We will review and discuss from a network perspective, the functional role of immature neurons and how their unique cellular properties can modulate the dentate network in memory guided behaviors.},

  abstract = {Metaplasticity, the plasticity of synaptic plasticity, is thought to have a pivotal role in activity-dependent modulation of synaptic connectivity, which underlies learning and memory. Metaplasticity is usually attributed to modifications in glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. However, experimental evidence and theoretical considerations suggest that learning reduces the predisposition for further synaptic strengthening, while behavioral studies show that learning capability is enhanced by prior learning. Here we show that enhanced neuronal excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons, but not enhanced synaptic transmission, occurs prior to rule learning of an olfactory discrimination task. This transient enhancement lasts for 1 day after rule learning, is apparent throughout the cell population and results from reduction in the medium and slow after-hyperpolarizations that control spike frequency adaptation. Such olfactory learning-induced increased excitability in hippocampal neurons enhances the rats' learning capability in another hippocampus-dependent task, the Morris water maze. Once olfactory discrimination rule learning is acquired, its maintenance is not dependent on the reduced post-burst AHP in hippocampal neurons. However, the enhanced spatial learning capability of olfactory-trained rats in the water maze is diminished once the post burst AHP in CA1 pyramidal cells resumes its initial value. We suggest that enhanced excitability of CA1 neurons may serve as a mechanism for generalized enhancement of hippocampus-dependent learning capability. In the presence of such enhanced neuronal excitability, the hippocampal network enters into a `learning mode' in which a variety of hippocampus-dependent skills are acquired rapidly and efficiently.},

  abstract = {We previously showed that the content of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the diet correlates with serum AGE levels, oxidant stress (OS), organ dysfunction, and lifespan. We now show that the addition of a chemically defined AGE (methyl-glyoxal-BSA) to low-AGE mouse chow increased serum levels of AGEs and OS, demonstrating that dietary AGEs are oxidants that can induce systemic OS. OS predisposes to the development of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases; calorie restriction (CR) is the most studied means to decrease OS, increase longevity, and reduce OS-related organ damage in mammals. Because reduction of food intake also decreases oxidant AGE s intake, we asked whether the beneficial effects of CR in mammals are related to the restriction of oxidants or energy. Pair-fed mice were provided either a CR diet or a high-AGE CR diet in which AGEs were elevated by brief heat treatment (CR-high). Old CR-high mice developed high levels of 8-isoprostanes, AGEs, RAGE, and p66(shc), coupled with low AGER1 and GSH/GSSG levels, insulin resistance, marked myocardial and renal fibrosis, and shortened lifespan. In contrast, old CR mice had low OS, p66(shc), RAGE, and AGE levels, but high AGER1 levels, coupled with longer lifespan. Therefore, the beneficial effects of a CR diet may be partly related to reduced oxidant intake, a principal determinant of oxidant status in aging mice, rather than decreased energy intake.},

  abstract = {Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) has been implicated in major neurological disorders, but its role in normal neuronal function is largely unknown. Here we show that GSK3beta mediates an interaction between two major forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD). In rat hippocampal slices, GSK3beta inhibitors block the induction of LTD. Furthermore, the activity of GSK3beta is enhanced during LTD via activation of PP1. Conversely, following the induction of LTP, there is inhibition of GSK3beta activity. This regulation of GSK3beta during LTP involves activation of NMDA receptors and the PI3K-Akt pathway and disrupts the ability of synapses to undergo LTD for up to 1 hr. We conclude that the regulation of GSK3beta activity provides a powerful mechanism to preserve information encoded during LTP from erasure by subsequent LTD, perhaps thereby permitting the initial consolidation of learnt information.},

Here, we attempt to overview the Arc system spanning from transcriptional regulation of the Arc gene, to dendritic transport, metabolism, and translation of Arc mRNA, to post-translational modification, localization, and degradation of Arc protein. Within this framework we discuss the function of Arc in regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics underlying consolidation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptor endocytosis underlying long-term depression (LTD) and homeostatic plasticity. Behaviorally, Arc has a key role in consolidation of explicit and implicit forms of memory, with recent work implicating Arc in adaptation to stress as well as maladaptive plasticity connected to drug addiction. Arc holds considerable promise as a ``master regulator'' of protein synthesis-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, but the mechanisms that modulate and switch Arc function are only beginning to be elucidated.},

  abstract = {The inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir) regulates resting membrane potential, K+ homeostasis, heart rate, and hormone secretion. The outward current is blocked in a voltage-dependent manner, upon the binding of intracellular polyamines or Mg2+ to the transmembrane pore domain. Meanwhile, electrophysiological studies have shown that mutations of several acidic residues in the intracellular regions affected the inward rectification. Although these acidic residues are assumed to bind polyamines, the functional role of the binding of polyamines and Mg2+ to the intracellular regions of Kirs remains unclear. Here, we report thermodynamic and structural studies of the interaction between polyamines and the cytoplasmic pore of mouse Kir3.1/GIRK1, which is gated by binding of G-protein betagamma-subunit (Gbetagamma). ITC analyses showed that two spermine molecules bind to a tetramer of Kir3.1/GIRK1 with a dissociation constant of 26 microM, which is lower than other blockers. NMR analyses revealed that the spermine binding site is Asp-260 and its surrounding area. Small but significant chemical shift perturbations upon spermine binding were observed in the subunit-subunit interface of the tetramer, suggesting that spermine binding alters the relative orientations of the four subunits. Our ITC and NMR results postulated a spermine binding mode, where one spermine molecule bridges two Asp-260 side chains from adjacent subunits, with rearrangement of the subunit orientations. This suggests the functional roles of spermine binding to the cytoplasmic pore: stabilization of the resting state conformation of the channel, and instant translocation to the transmembrane pore upon activation through the Gbetagamma-induced conformational rearrangement.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has greatly extended the exploration of neuroplasticity in behaving animals and humans. Imaging studies recently uncovered structural changes that occur in gray and white matter, mainly after long-term training. A recent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study showed that training in a car racing game for 2 h induces changes in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri. However, the effect of short-term training on the white matter microstructure is unknown. Here we investigated the influence of short learning tasks on structural plasticity in the white matter, and specifically in the fornix, in humans and rats. Human subjects performed a 2 h spatial learning task, and rats underwent training for 1 d in a Morris water maze. Between tasks, subjects were scanned with DTI, a diffusion MRI framework sensitive to tissue microstructure. Using tract-based spatial statistics, we found changes in diffusivity indices in both humans and rats. In both species, changes in diffusion in the fornix were correlated with diffusion changes in the hippocampus, as well as with behavioral measures of improvement in the learning tasks. These results, which provide the first indication of short-term white matter plasticity in the human brain, suggest that the adult brain white matter preserves dynamic characteristics and can be modified by short-term learning experiences. The extent of change in white matter was correlated with their extent in gray matter, suggesting that all components of the neural network are capable of rapid remodeling in response to cognitive experiences.},

  abstract = {Long-term synaptic plasticity is fundamental to learning and network function. It has been studied under various induction protocols and depends on firing rates, membrane voltage, and precise timing of action potentials. These protocols show different facets of a common underlying mechanism but they are mostly modeled as distinct phenomena. Here, we show that all of these different dependencies can be explained from a single computational principle. The objective is a sparse distribution of excitatory synaptic strength, which may help to reduce metabolic costs associated with synaptic transmission. Based on this objective we derive a stochastic gradient ascent learning rule which is of differential-Hebbian type. It is formulated in biophysical quantities and can be related to current mechanistic theories of synaptic plasticity. The learning rule accounts for experimental findings from all major induction protocols and explains a classic phenomenon of metaplasticity. Furthermore, our model predicts the existence of metaplasticity for spike-timing-dependent plasticity Thus, we provide a theory of long-term synaptic plasticity that unifies different induction protocols and provides a connection between functional and mechanistic levels of description.},

  doi = {10.1101/lm.993608},
  abstract = {Although the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) is essential for conditioned auditory fear memory, an emerging theme is that plasticity in multiple brain regions contributes to fear memory formation. The LA receives direct projections from the auditory thalamus, specifically the medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGm) and adjacent posterior intralaminar nucleus (PIN). While traditionally viewed as a simple relay structure, mounting evidence implicates the thalamus in diverse cognitive processes. We investigated the role of plasticity in the MGm/PIN in auditory fear memory. First we found that auditory fear conditioning (but not control manipulations) increased the levels of activated CREB in both the MGm and PIN. Next, using viral vectors, we showed that exogenously increasing CREB in this region specifically enhanced formation of an auditory conditioned fear memory without affecting expression of an auditory fear memory, formation of a contextual fear memory, or basic auditory processing. Interestingly, mice with increased CREB levels in the MGm/PIN also showed broad auditory fear generalization (in contrast to control mice, they exhibited fear responses to tones of other frequencies). Together, these results implicate CREB-mediated plasticity in the MGm/PIN in both the formation and generalization of conditioned auditory fear memory. Not only do these findings refine our knowledge of the circuitry underlying fear memory but they also provide novel insights into the neural substrates that govern the degree to which acquired fear of a tone generalizes to other tones.},
